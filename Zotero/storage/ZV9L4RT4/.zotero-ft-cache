Zhi Sun, Bin Zi, and Yuan Li


Abstract— In this paper, a hybrid driven knee orthosis using Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuator is proposed. First, the mechanical design of the actuator system is presented. The device mainly consists of the DC motor module and the SMA spring actuator module, and the two independent operating actuators realize the hybrid drive through the electromagnetic clutch connection. Then, the constitutive model for SMA spring and mathematical model for DC motor system are established respectively to describe the output characteristics of the actuator. Finally, a series of numerical simulations are implemented on SMA springs and the DC motor to determine the changing parameters of the SMA actuator during the heating phase transition and the load characteristics of the motor.
I. INTRODUCTION
Rehabilitation training with robots instead of physicians became a hot field of research due to the lack of medical resources. Recent researches showed that repeated motion training with robots can restore the patient's body mobility [1]. Compared with physicians, robots have higher accuracy and can measure the speed, acceleration and displacement of patient movements, to provide data reference for future training [2]. Due to the successful application experience of robots in the industry, a variety of exoskeleton and traction rehabilitation robots were developed. Gong Chen et al. [3] designed a portable knee-ankle-foot robot with a novel compliant series elastic actuator for patients to implement gaiting training. In [4], a two-link robot arm with pneumatic muscles was developed to imitate the dynamic properties of human muscles to obtain elastic output. NEUROExos is a novel elbow exoskeleton robot, which can transfer the joint torque within a safe range to avoid patient injury [5]. Owing to the characteristic of large working space and flexible, cable was widely used as the actuator for rehabilitation robot [6, 7]. Chen Qiao et al. [8] proposed a cable-driven parallel waist rehabilitation robot with fuzzy-PID control algorithm, which can consider the robot security while ensuring the motion accuracy.
When using the exoskeleton rehabilitation robot, the comfort and safety are very important, so it is required that the joint actuator has certain elasticity and flexibility. In the late stage of rehabilitation training, in order to strengthen the muscle strength of patients, it is necessary to apply reverse variable damping force to patients [9, 10]. SMA is smart material which was widely used as a power source for space

engineering, precision drive structure and medical devices [11]. SMA has a special mechanical property called shape memory effect (SME). When the SMA is deformed in martensitic state and, upon the increase of temperature austenite transformation occurring, it will return to its original state. Based on the unique property and the combination of SMA and other matrix materials, various new actuating and executing integrated devices can be designed [12-14]. The SMA can be made into spring shape, which can greatly improve the output displacement and simulate the mechanical characteristics of human muscle contraction. However, these flexible actuators can not meet the requirements of structural stiffness in rehabilitation training, and provide low driving force. The traditional rigid actuators, such as motor, can make up for these defects, so the combination of the two actuators to achieve rigid flexible coupling drive can be a method to improve the performance of rehabilitation equipment.
In this paper, a hybrid driven knee orthosis with a pair of antagonistic-arranged SMA actuators is proposed. SMA completes its shape memory effect through thermal elasticity and martensitic phase transition, so temperature is an important variable to study the actuator performance. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, according to the motion of human knee joint, the mechanical structure of hybrid driven knee orthosis with SMA actuator is presented. In section 3, the Liang-Rogers model is introduced to describe the thermodynamic properties of SMA during the martensitic transformation, and the physical model of DC motor system is established. Based on the mechanical model, numerical simulation results verify the output performance of actuators in section 4. Section 5 summarizes the main content of the paper.
II. MECHANICAL DESIGN
Compared with other parts of the human body, such as wrist, which has three degrees of freedom, and the knee joint has only one degree of freedom of rotation, which is suitable for the installation of complex driving assemblies. The hybrid driven knee orthosis is mainly composed of SMA actuator module, DC motor module, transmission module and support module. Figure 1 shows the 3D model of the hybrid driven knee orthosis.

The output shaft of the reducer is connected with the electromagnetic clutch through the flat key, and the output shaft of the other end of the clutch is connected with the smaller pulley. The larger pulley is fixed on the rotating shaft of knee joint, and the two pulleys are connected by belt. The connection and disconnection of electromagnetic clutch can be realized by controlling the current on and off, and then the rotation of DC motor can be transmitted to knee joint shaft, or the SMA actuator can work independently.

A. SMA Spring Actuator Module
The SMA actuator module is composed of with a pair of antagonistic-arranged SMA actuators. Each actuator is composed of three SMA springs with the same initial state. The geometric parameters of SMA spring are given in Table I. The two actuators are connected and fixed on the knee joint shaft pulley by belt. When the actuator is installed, one set of SMA spring actuators is in the stretched state, while the other set remains in the initial unstressed state. When the SMA actuator is heated to the martensitic transformation temperature, the spring shrinks along the axis and rotates the knee joint through the pulley. The output shaft of the pulley is connected with a group of planetary acceleration gears, and the output shaft of the gears is connected with the knee joint rotation shaft. The actuator returns to the initial state and stretches another set of the SMA actuator. By heating the SMA actuators on both sides, they cycle to complete the stretch and contraction of the spring, so as to complete the knee flexion and extension.

B. DC Motor Module
When actuating knee joint rotation with the SMA actuator, it can imitate the expansion and extension of thigh muscles, which has good flexibility and provides reverse damping. However, the output torque of SMA driver is small and inaccurate. DC motor driving module can make up for these defects. Figure 2 shows the mechanism diagram of the hybrid driven knee orthosis. The DC motor module and SMA actuator module are symmetrically arranged on both sides of the human lower limb. The brushless DC motor (DJI, M3508) is connected with an electromagnetic clutch through a flange

III. ACTUATORS MODELING

In this section, we obtain the dynamic characteristics of the material by establishing the thermodynamic model of SMA spring, then establish the physical model of a pair of SMA spring actuators with antagonistic arrangement to obtain the output displacement, and finally derive the output characteristics of the knee joint under the coupling input combined with the brushless DC motor model.

A. Constitutive Model for SMA Springs

IV. MATHEMATICAL CALCULATION AND SIMULATION
In order to obtain the specific output performance of SMA actuator module and DC motor module and determine the

parameters of physical prototype parts in the future, it needs to be studied through mathematical calculation and simulation. According to the analysis in the previous sections, it can be concluded that the main parameter affecting the performance of SMA actuator is temperature, which also determines the martensite volume fraction of SMA, thus affecting the stiffness of the SMA spring. When the mechanical structure parameters of the motor module are determined, the main factors that affect the output characteristics of the motor are the input voltage and load torque.

A. Characterization of the SMA spring
Table II shows the material parameters used to calculate the mechanical properties of SMA spring by thermal constitutive model. A group of SMA springs in stretch state during installation were selected as the analysis object to study the process of spring shrinkage caused by martensite transformation. The martensite volume fraction of SMA spring during phase transformation is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5. Martensite volume fraction of the SMA spring
According to the analysis in Figure 5, when the temperature is lower than M f , the SMA spring is in martensite phase.
When the martensite is in twin state, it will be transformed into detwinned martensite phase to counteract the strain. When heating the SMA spring, martensite transformation occurs, the material transforms from martensite to austenite, and the volume fraction of martensite decreases. When the temperature is higher than M s , the martensite structure completely transforms into austenite structure, and the volume fraction of martensite is 0. The stiffness of the SMA spring at various temperatures can be calculated by formula (7) and (12), as shown in Figure 6. The stiffness of SMA spring increases in martensite state, transformation mixing state and austenite

state in turn. This material damping effect is due to the relative motion of molecules during the phase transformation of SMA, which makes the kinetic energy of micro particles convert into heat energy.

Figure 6. The stiffness of SMA spring during the transformation
Figure 7 shows the relationship between stress and spring output force when heating the SMA actuator. When the temperature is higher than Af , SMA is in the stage of austenite
elastic deformation, the stress increases gradually and the strain increases linearly. Then martensite transformation occurs and the SMA spring is in an inelastic state, while the strain remains unchanged. Finally, the SMA actuator shrinks and the strain also decreases. When the SMA spring returns to austenite state, the strain can completely return to the initial value. Without considering the friction, the driving force of the SMA spring is determined by the stiffness and displacement. At the beginning of phase transformation, although the spring stiffness increases, the rapid contraction of the spring leads to the decrease of displacement and output force. A single SMA spring can output a maximum force of 0.25N.

Figure 8. The load characteristic curve
When the input voltage of the motor is certain, the load and the motor speed are linear within the operating range. The DC motor usually changes the input voltage to adjust the speed. The amplitude of the voltage is adjusted by changing the duty cycle of the input square wave signal. The blue curve represents the load characteristic of the motor calculated by (13), which is different from the load characteristic curve measured by the manufacturer. In the example, only the influence of inductance and resistance on load characteristics is considered. Figure 9 shows the relationship between motor efficiency and power as the load increases.

Figure 7. The stress and spring output force curve
B. Load characteristics of the DC motor
Table III shows the parameters of the brushless DC motor. The error between the theoretical output and the actual output of the DC motor drive module mainly comes from the installation error and the friction of electromagnetic clutch. The friction of electromagnetic clutch needs to measure the viscosity between planes, so it is ignored in the numerical calculation. The motor is controlled by a DC motor driver (DJI, Z650). The load characteristics of the motor are shown in Figure 8.

Figure 9. The motor power and efficiency curve
Similar to the energy loss of the SMA actuator, the energy loss of motor is mainly converted into the heat of armature resistance. As shown in Figure 9, the maximum efficiency of the motor is about 67%. In order to improve the working efficiency of the motor, the speed should be kept above 250 rpm.

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a hybrid driven knee orthosis with SMA actuator is designed. Compared with the previous rigid drive rehabilitation robot system, hybrid driven knee orthosis robot has two distributed independent working actuators. The mechanical structure is firstly presented, including a pair of SMA spring actuator with antagonistic arrangement, a brushless DC motor and auxiliary module. When the SMA actuator is heated, the martensite transformation is produced to complete the contraction action, and another group of spring actuators is stretched. The spring structure can imitate the contraction and extension of human lower limb muscles, and provide reverse damping for rehabilitation training. The brushless DC motor transmits the rotation to the knee joint shaft through the electromagnetic clutch, and the SMA driver can work alone or hybrid driven with the motor through the connection and disconnection of the clutch. The thermal constitutive model of the SMA is established to determine the effect of material parameters on the output performance of the actuator. The mathematical model of the DC motor module is established to describe the load characteristics of the actuator. A series of numerical calculations are carried out, and the output characteristics of the actuators under the given material parameters and motor structure parameters are obtained. As part of our continuing work, we are working on building an actual wearable physical prototype and testing the output performance of the actuators in rehabilitation training.
