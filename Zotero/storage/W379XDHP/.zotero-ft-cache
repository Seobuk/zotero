ABSTRACT This paper proposes an electrical parameter estimation method for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) considering the voltage source inverter (VSI) nonlinearity. Accurate parameters are essential for high-performance control of PMSMs. Therefore, numerous studies have been conducted to obtain accurate parameters. However, the VSI nonlinearity causes voltage distortion, which causes parameter-estimation errors. To address this problem, this paper presents a solution using the double-frequency double-amplitude (DFDA) injection method based on the high-frequency (HF) injection method. The proposed method is a practical and novel method using simple mathematical calculations that takes into account VSI nonlinearity without using nonlinearity-compensation methods. It increases the accuracy and reduces the resistance-estimation step by simultaneously estimating the stator resistance and inductance. To demonstrate the efficacy and practicability of the proposed method, it was experimentally verified on a 400 W surface-mounted PMSM. The proposed method can simultaneously estimate the stator resistance and inductance with high accuracy within a short time and can, therefore, be applied to PMSM drives in various industries, such as robotics.

I. INTRODUCTION Permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) are widely used in various fields owing to their high efficiency, energy density, and torque density [1]–[3]. Determination of PMSM parameters is essential for almost all types of control, such as current control based on vector control, and accurate PMSM parameters are required for highperformance control [4]–[6]. Additionally, the parameters are useful for fault detection [7]. The effect of parameter inaccuracy when controlling the current based on vector control has been analytically observed to be detrimental [2][8][9], particularly in sensorless control [10][11].
Various parameter estimation methods have been proposed in previous studies to obtain accurate parameters, both online and offline. Generally, offline estimation

methods can only be implemented in dedicated laboratories because they require high-performance measurement or specialized equipment. Performing online estimation in actual industrial-field applications is challenging because of the complexity of the algorithms used to control and estimate the PMSM parameters in real time [12][13].
Self-commissioning is a subcategory of offline estimation methods. It is used to accurately identify parameters under limited conditions, such as the unlocked rotor, while using available sensors within a short time, without using additional hardware. Consequently, the self-commissioning method is becoming increasingly important for parameter estimation [12].

The parameter estimation method based on the voltage equation is commonly employed for electrical parameter estimation [14]. The reference voltage is commonly used for parameter estimation because directly measuring the terminal voltage of a motor is difficult. However, owing to the voltage source inverter (VSI) nonlinearity, distortion occurs in the reference and actual voltage applied to the motor [15].
The voltage distortion varies based on the current direction, thereby limiting the generality of the estimation method. These adverse conditions can cause estimation errors [13].
Voltage distortion can be compensated using a sign function to account for the estimation error caused by the VSI nonlinearity [16]. Errors have been considered using model-based compensation [17]. Additionally, a compensation measure using a self-learning method based on the Hermite interpolation method has been developed [18]. However, the VSI nonlinearity cannot be accurately compensated for using only the sign function. Although selflearning can accurately compensate for voltage distortion, its implementation in industrial applications is challenging because it requires additional processes and learning time. In summary, estimation errors caused by VSI nonlinearity are a significant problem that require an immediate solution in the parameter estimation method based on the voltage equation [19].
The signal injection method is effective for parameter estimation [18]. In [20], an inductance and initial position are estimated using the voltage pulse injection method, and stator resistance is estimated using the DC voltage injection method.
The high-frequency (HF) injection method, which is a subcategory of signal injection methods, is the most widely used method for estimating inductance [18]. In [18], inductance estimation using the hysteresis control-based HF injection method considering the VSI nonlinearity is proposed. In [21], an inductance and initial position are estimated through a spatial inductance mapping algorithm using the HF injection method. In [22], an inductance is estimated using the HF injection method. Interturn shortcircuit fault detection is performed using the estimated inductance. As presented in previous studies, HF injection methods are a good solution for inductance estimation.
This paper proposes the double-frequency doubleamplitude (DFDA) injection method based on the HF injection method to estimate the PMSM parameters, as a practical and novel solution to the parameter estimation method. The proposed method increases the accuracy by estimating the parameters considering the VSI nonlinearity. Furthermore, the stator resistance and inductance are simultaneously estimated to reduce the resistance estimation step. Furthermore, the proposed method is a selfcommissioning method and estimates the parameters without additional hardware.
The contribution of this study is that the error due to the voltage distortion effect is reduced considering the VSI nonlinearity using a simple equation, without using a

nonlinearity-compensation method. Moreover, the stator resistance and inductance are simultaneously estimated; therefore, the resistance estimation step is reduced to identify parameters in a short time.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the mathematical PMSM modeling. Section III describes the current control system and currentcontrol gain-selection method. Section IV introduces the parameter estimation method. Section V presents the results of the parameter estimation and transient response characteristics experiments and Section VI presents the experimental results. Lastly, Section VII presents the conclusions of this study.

IV. ELECTRICAL PARAMETER ESTIMATION METHOD

A. EXISTING INDUCTANCE ESTIMATION METHOD

The HF injection method is the most commonly used method

to estimate the inductance [18].

Assuming that the output of the VSI ideally does not exhibit

nonlinearity, as expressed in (11), where the d-axis current

flows according to (12), the impedance can be expressed as

in (13).

vdrs  Vac sin(ht) ,

(11)

idrs  Iac sin(ht   ) ,

(12)

Zs  Rs2  L2sh2 ,

(13)

where h denotes the injected frequency, Vac indicates the amplitude of the injected HF voltage, Iac denotes the amplitude of the induced HF current, and Zs represents the impedance at h .
In the HF injection method, if the resistance component is

ignored, assuming that the reactance component resulting

from the inductance has a large resistance component, the

inductance can be calculated as in (14) [21].

However, the VSI nonlinearity distorts the output voltage

of the actual inverter. Thus, the inductance expressed as (15)

where Lˆs denotes the estimated inductance, Zˆs represents the estimated impedance at h , Va*c represents the amplitude of the injected HF voltage command, and V indicates the

voltage distortion owing to the VSI nonlinearity.

If the resistance component is ignored, the inductance is

estimated as in (16). This causes an estimation error, and the

desired control performance is not achieved.

Furthermore, as shown in Section III, the identification of

both the inductance and resistance is necessary to configure a

current controller. Therefore, additional steps are required to

estimate the resistance.

B. PROPOSED SIMULTANEOUS PARAMETER ESTIMATION METHOD This study presents the simultaneous parameter estimation method to overcome the problem faced by the existing inductance estimation method. The VSI nonlinearity is considered through two voltage signals having different amplitudes. In addition, the combined HF signal is injected to simultaneously estimate the stator resistance and inductance.

levels of the injected frequency and test region, respectively

(i, j = 1 or 2). However, the power factor remains identical if the amplitude of the voltage (Vij* ) at each frequency increases
at the same ratio without a change in frequency. Assuming

that the voltage distortion owing to the VSI nonlinearity

saturates above a certain current level, the voltage distortions

in regions 1 ( Vi1 ) and 2 ( Vi2 ) are identical [18]. Therefore, if Vi  Vi1  Vi2 , the impedance at each frequency can be estimated as follows (18):

V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The performance of the proposed electrical parameter
estimation method was experimentally verified using a 400 W SPMSM. Additionally, the proposed method performs parameter estimation with minimum information such as rated voltage, rated current, and number of poles. The experimental platform is shown in Fig. 5, and the parameters of the PMSM used in the experiment are shown in Table 1. The block diagram of the parameter estimation method is presented in Fig. 6. In the experimental analysis, the alignment of the PMSM was completed before implementing the parameter estimation method.

current information at the selected current levels Ilevel1 and . Ilevel 2 Ilevel1 and Ilevel 2 were set at 25% and 30% of the rated current, and the injected frequencies Fh1 and Fh2 are set at 250 Hz and 500 Hz, respectively. Fh2 used a multiple of Fh1 for the convenience of the fast Fourier transform calculation. The switching frequency was 10 kHz. The
experiment was conducted by changing the dead time from 1
μs to 5 μs in increments of 1 μs to analyze the effect of the
VSI nonlinearity due to the dead time.

The output waveform of the proposed method, where the stator resistance and inductance are simultaneously estimated using DFDA injection, is illustrated in Fig. 7. The results and error rates of the proposed parameter estimation method are presented in Fig. 8. The estimation results of the stator resistance and inductance according to dead time are presented in Figs. 8(a) and 8(b), respectively. The stator resistance was estimated with an error rate of 5.74%–9.71%, regardless of the change in dead time, as shown in Fig. 8(a). The inductance was estimated with an error rate of 2.55%– 4.91%, regardless of the change in dead time, as shown in Fig. 8(b).

FIGURE 10. Parameter estimation results of the existing method
The output waveform of the existing method and inductance estimation through HF injection are shown in Fig. 9, and the results and error rates of the existing parameter estimation method are illustrated in Fig. 10. The existing parameter estimation method ignores resistance components through HF injection; therefore, it is used only for inductance estimation, and the inductance-estimation error rate increases from 17.09% to 92.55% as the dead time increases.
For the existing method, the estimated inductance value gradually increases as the dead time increases, as shown in Figs. 9 and 10. Conversely, the proposed method has almost constant inductance and resistance values when estimated considering the dead-time variation. Further, its variation width is also smaller than that of the existing method. Thus, the parameter estimation method proposed using the experimental results effectively resolved the estimation error problem caused by the VSI nonlinearity.
C. STEP RESPONSE EXPERIMENT The current step response experiment was performed to verify the parameters obtained using the proposed method. Using these parameters, the current-controller gains are evaluated as shown in (6) and (7), and the d- and q-axis current step response experiments were performed by compensating for the feedforward terms, as shown in (9) and (10). The PI gains of the current controller are tuned using the electrical parameters obtained using the proposed method at a dead time of 1 μs, as shown in (6) and (7). The experiment was conducted by changing the cutoff frequency of the current controller from 100 Hz to 500 Hz in increments of 100 Hz. The d- and q-axis experiment results are shown in Figs. 11 and 12, respectively. The time constant was measured based on the current step response using the curve fitting of the measured d- and q-axis current signals. The curve-fitting results of the current response according to Fcc are shown in Figs. 11(b) and 12(b).

The error rate of the transient response characteristics of the d- and q-axis current step responses of the current controller, which were tuned using the proposed parameter estimation method, ranged from 0.1% to 8.74%, as shown in Fig. 13. Consequently, the parameters estimated using the proposed method exhibit excellent transient-response characteristics of less than 9%. Thus, the estimation accuracy of the electrical parameters is verified.

VI. DISCUSSION In the existing method, the parameter estimation error
increases with the increase in the dead time. However, the proposed method presented a parameter estimation error of less than 10%, regardless of the change in the dead time. Furthermore, the desired transient response characteristics can be achieved by tuning the gains of the current controller using the parameters obtained through the proposed method. The experimental results of the current step response demonstrated that the proposed parameter estimation method can accurately estimate the parameters; it obtained transient response characteristics with an error within 9%. Moreover, the procedure of the proposed electrical parameter estimation method can be completed within 1.1 s, depending on the setting, such as the slope of the applied voltage.
The proposed method is highly effective for low-capacity PMSMs having relatively high stator resistances. Therefore, it is suitable for applications that use PMSMs in relatively

VOLUME XX, 2017

small capacities, such as robots and servo control. However, one major limitation of the method is that it is not highly effective when used at low resistances. This can be attributed to the fact that when the resistance is relatively low, inductance accounts for most of the impedance, increasing the difficulty of estimating the resistance using the HF injection-based method.
In the future, the estimation of electrical parameters applicable to PMSMs with a relatively small stator resistance and the estimation of mechanical parameters required to tune the speed and position controllers should be considered.
VII. CONCLUSION This study proposed a simultaneous estimation method for
stator resistance and inductance considering the VSI nonlinearity. To achieve this, two HF voltage signals were combined and injected. Accordingly, the parameter estimation time was shortened by reducing the resistance estimation step. In addition, using a simple mathematical equation without nonlinearity-compensation method, the estimation of accuracy considering the VSI nonlinearity increased.
The accuracy of the estimated parameters was verified from the parameter estimation results and transient response characteristics. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by comparing it with the existing method. Therefore, it can be applied to PMSM drives in various industries, such as robotics.
