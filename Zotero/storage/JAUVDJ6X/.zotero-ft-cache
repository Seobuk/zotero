Abstract: In this paper, we propose a shape memory alloy (SMA)-based wearable robot that assists the wrist motion for patients who have diﬃculties in manipulating the lower arm. Since SMA shows high contraction strain when it is designed as a form of coil spring shape, the proposed muscle-like actuator was designed after optimizing the spring parameters. The fabricated actuator shows a maximum force of 10 N and a maximum contraction ratio of 40%. The SMA-based wearable robot, named soft wrist assist (SWA), assists 2 degrees of freedom (DOF) wrist motions. In addition, the robot is totally ﬂexible and weighs 151g for the wearable parts. A maximum torque of 1.32 Nm was measured for wrist ﬂexion, and a torque of larger than 0.5 Nm was measured for the other motions. The robot showed the average range of motion (ROM) with 33.8, 30.4, 15.4, and 21.4 degrees for ﬂexion, extension, ulnar, and radial deviation, respectively. Thanks to the soft feature of the SWA, time cost for wearing the device is shorter than 2 min as was also the case for patients when putting it on by themselves. From the experimental results, the SWA is expected to support wrist motion for diverse activities of daily living (ADL) routinely for patients.

1. Introduction
Loss of mobility and power in the upper extremity (UE) is a common symptom resulting from damage to the peripheral nervous system, muscle weakness, tendon disorders, muscle contracture and change in muscle tone after an accident or a medical disorder such as cerebral palsy, stroke, traumatic brain injury or damage to the spinal cord [1–6]. The disabilities of the upper extremity can manifest themselves individually more often, but they also occur in combination. Also, several of these neurological diseases are chronic as well as progressive [3,4]. Consequently, the ability to perform voluntary movement and ﬁne motor and manipulation skills are lost [7]. This results in loss of independence during the performance of tasks required in activities of daily living (ADL) such as feeding, self-hygiene, dressing and transferring [8].
Especially for rehabilitation treatment, there is less improvement of patients in the wrist mobility compared to the shoulder or elbow. The radiocarpal joint is one of the major and complex parts of the upper extremity, comprising of bones, ligaments, nerves, tendons and connective tissues. Its anatomy allows a wide spectrum of intricate movements necessary in performing day-to-day tasks, which in turn, makes it susceptible to injuries [9]. Compression or damage to the radial, ulnar and median nerve of the wrist such as wrist drop, ulnar claw or carpal tunnel syndrome also lead to chronic

wrist impairment. Owing to the motor, neurological and perceptual defects of the wrist joint, the quality of life and independence of the patient reduces along with the adverse eﬀect on the ability to perform ADL. Moreover, the reduced mobility at the wrist results in compensatory movement of the shoulder, and the elbow [10]. In many cases, physical therapy leads to recovery by stimulating the aﬀected muscles together with leveraging neuroplasticity [11,12]. Similarly, rehabilitation in the form of repetitive motions and exercises have resulted in restoring some degree of motor loss [13] and cortical reorganization while regaining some portion of the lost sensorimotor skills [14]. Findings of 6 months of longitudinal studies reveal that about 30 to 66% of hemiplegic patients, had little or no function in the paralyzed arm, whereas only 5 to 20% showed complete functional recovery [15]. Nevertheless, recovery is not limited to the months following stroke [16] with rehabilitation of the UE being reported many years after stroke [17]. Also, manual therapeutic rehabilitation where the therapist has to guide the paralyzed limb directly requires a daily treatment, which makes the treatment diﬃcult and expensive [18].
In the past decades, researchers have developed many robotic rehabilitation systems [19–35]. A few investigations show that the improvement of recovery for acute and chronic patients facing stroke, cerebral palsy and injury to the spinal cord was observed from rehabilitation treatment by applying robotic systems [19–23]. Conventionally used rehabilitation robots have rigid structures and the force to the patients is delivered primarily by a motor located at the respective joint. However, these robots are not suitable in wearable applications since the rigid links and joints are heavy and bulky. Also, the limitation of the degrees of freedom (DOF) causes inconvenience for the user.
Applying soft robotic technologies is a great approach for a compact, lightweight, user-friendly and portable exoskeleton for the upper limb, since the soft actuators and sensors are lightweight, compact and have high DOFs [36–45]. Pneumatic actuators are widely used for wearable applications since they can produce high force compared to that of other soft actuators along with large deformations. Several soft wearable robots for the wrist using multiple pneumatic actuators that produce bending or linear contraction motion were suggested [36–40]. However, the systems that use the pneumatic actuators require compressors and regulators, which in turn makes it hard to be used as a portable robot. Tendon-driven systems are also generally employed for designing wearable robots [42–45]. The use of Bowden cables along with DC motors [42,43] or twisted coil actuators [44] allows locating the actuators away from the point of interest, reducing the weight on the wearer and mobilizing the external joints that were constrained using the rigid exoskeleton. For example, Choi et al. used a simple cable-driven wearable robot with ﬂexible polymer structures and an active anchor to produce the dart-throwing motion of the wrist [45]. However, further improvement in the anchoring mechanism is needed to accomplish a precise and repetitive motion.
Recently, Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) has been highlighted as a potential material to be used as an artiﬁcial muscle thanks to its unique characteristics of shape memory eﬀects [46]. The shape change of the SMA is caused by the change in crystalline arrangement with change in temperature. The actuators that are fabricated using SMA can produce high force and can be rapidly actuated via Joule heating. Also, the SMA actuators that are shaped as a coil spring are capable of producing large strains, over 200% of their initially contracted length. The wearable robots targeting the UE that utilize wire type SMA actuators have been introduced [47–49]. However, slow response and the need of a passive force to pre-stretch the actuator makes practical implementation for such systems diﬃcult.
In this paper, we propose a new soft SMA-based wearable wrist robot aimed at portability and compliance, so that the wearer can use the robot independently and eﬀortlessly. Our device focuses on the 2-DOF wrist motion occurring near the two non-aligned axis of the radiocarpal joint; namely extension, ﬂexion and ulnar and radial deviation. In this paper, the design process of the highly stretchable, fast-response muscle-like actuator is described ﬁrst by optimizing the parameters of the SMA coil spring and the cooling system of the actuator. Next, the design process and the performances of the wearable robot are described. The fabricated wearable robot can produce the 2-DOF motion of the wrist by selectively activating the muscle-like actuators. Finally, user tests were performed to

observe the wearability and the range of motion (ROM). Time spent for self and assistive wearing were measured as well as the ROM of the SWA for ﬁve subjects.

2. Design of Muscle-Like Actuator Based on Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) Coil Spring
Typical type of SMA for actuator applications is in the form of wires [47–50]. The advantage of the wire-shaped SMA actuator is that it can produce high forces compared to the other soft actuator technologies such as Ionic Polymer Metal Composites [51], dielectric elastomers [52], shape-morphing polymers [53] and hydrogels [54]. However, the strain that the actuator can produce is relatively low (<8% of its initial length) [46], which is insuﬃcient for the use in making a wearable robot. In order to enhance actuating performance, SMA can be shaped in the shape of coiled springs that result in substantially larger displacement when it is utilized as an actuator [46,55–59]. The coil spring shaped SMA actuators have large extension strain over 200% [46,55], which is enough for the desired application as the strain of a SMA coil spring is larger than that exhibited by human muscles [60].
Another shortcoming faced when working with SMA actuators is the slow response due to the diﬃculty of both heating up and cooling down the SMA rapidly in the same system. Generally, many SMA-based actuators are operated in ambient air, which oﬀers a fast heating rate, but the limitation is a slow cooling rate as well [46–49,59]. To enhance the response speed of SMA based actuators, a few works have applied water as an alternative coolant during the actuation of the SMA [50,55–58]. Park et al. developed SMA coil spring-based actuator that was composed of the SMA coil spring bundles and a stretchable polymer tube that can stretch over 300% of its initial length [55–57]. The heat transfer from water activated the SMA coil spring, and the temperature of the water that ﬂows through the tube was controlled by the faucet-like valve system, which adjusts the amount of hot and cool water from the reservoir. The above-mentioned actuator showed up to 50% contraction strain when 5kg load was applied with 1Hz actuation speed. However, this actuation method is not suitable for wearable applications since large reservoirs for hot and cool water are needed.
The highly stretchable muscle-like actuator proposed in this work is designed based on SMA coil springs and coolant circuit for a thin, high force, displacement, and fast response. Figure 1 shows the schematic design of the proposed actuator. In order to make the actuator thin, one SMA coil spring is integrated with a coolant circulation system. An electrical wire is connected to both the ends of the SMA coil spring while attaching it tightly at the end of a Polycarbonate connector containing the coolant ﬂow inlet and outlet. The temperature of the SMA increases when the electrical current is applied to the SMA as the SMA itself is resistance. A stretchable polymer tube that is designed to surround the SMA coil spring is used for the ﬂow of coolant. The polymer tube is made with Ecoﬂex 00-30 (Smooth on Co). It stretches and contracts in conjunction with the SMA coil spring thanks to its high stretchability of over 300% of its initial length. The tubes attach to the pump and the radiator was connected to the other end of the connectors. The coolant ﬂows in closed circulation. The initial diameter of the stretchable polymer tube before stretching is selected as 7 mm. The width and height of the connectors are less than 15 mm. Mineral oil is chosen as a coolant that ﬂows inside the tube.
In order to design the SMA coil spring for a wearable robot, the actuator parameters which determine the maximum force as well as displacement should be analyzed. Adjustable parameters for designing conventional spring are described in Figure 2. The relationship between force and displacement of the spring is Equation (1):

Several target performances of the proposed muscle-like actuator are determined for the wearable robot application. The actuator should be designed to produce high force in the desired deformation range. As preloading the SMA is required to be stretched, the target range of deformation is determined under load conditions. The target force required is 10 N per a single coil spring. The target maximum contraction ratio is selected to be greater than 40% of its initial stretched length, which exhibits a similar contraction ratio as that of a human muscle [60]. The target displacement range is selected as 50 mm Afrpoplm. Sciit.s20in19i,ti9a, lx sFtOreRtPchEEeRdRleEnVgIEtWh when a 10 N load is applied to the spring samples.

Sample 4 and 5 have relatively low stiﬀness compare to sample 1, 2 and 3 since the wire diameter is smaller. Additionally, the actuator has to be heated to a higher temperature to exert high force compared to other samples. Sample 1, 2 shows enough force over 10 N, but it needs larger displacement range than the target value. The optimal SMA coil spring is selected as sample 3 since it satisﬁes the target force in the displacement range, is the thinnest, and has the lowest transition temperature.

the SWA is designed by simply attaching multiple SMA-based actuators at desired locations, the torque and ROM can be easily increased by attaching additional actuators to the robot.
The wearability is assessed by measuring the time spent wearing the robot. The experiments were conducted in consideration of the fact that the robot is designed to be used by patients who have diﬃculties in manipulating lower arm. Two scenarios were provided for the experiments; self and assistive wearing. The self-wearing experiment was conducted to observe how easily the patients could wear the robot on their own. Therefore, the subjects wore the robot on the passive hand, by using only one hand in this experiment. In the assistive wearing experiment, the time that it takes to attach the robot to the patients by an assistant was measured.
Figure 10b shows the measured average wearing times of two experiments. The average time spent on self-wearing was measured as 87 s. The average assistive wearing time was measured at 75 s. The step that consumed the most time was inserting ﬁngers into the glove in both experiments. The fact that it takes less than 2 min to wear the robot indicates that the proposed robot system can be worn easily. In particular, the experimental result of the self-wearing implies that the proposed robot can be worn solely by the patient with only one hand in about 80 to 90 s. Therefore, the patients facing motor impairments in their wrist can also wear the robot without the need for external assistance.
4. Conclusions and Future Work
A need for wearable robots that are ﬂexible, easy to wear, lightweight and provide enough force has increased for patients who have diﬃculties in manipulating their bodies. This paper shows the ﬁrst step in the development of a new type of soft wearable robot. We demonstrated an SMA-based soft wearable robot made for the assistance of wrist motion. To design a wearable robot that possesses such advantages for supporting the wrist, several design processes are carried out. To design a wearable robot that possesses such advantages for assisting the wrist, several design processes are carried out in this paper. Firstly, a highly stretchable muscle-like actuator is designed to achieve the target performances of force and contraction ratio required for wearable applications. The optimal design of the SMA coil spring is selected by comparing the force-displacement relationships of ﬁve coil springs samples. In order to enhance the response speed, an active cooling system using mineral oil was integrated with the SMA coil spring. The fabricated muscle-like actuator shows a maximum force of 10 N and a maximum contraction ratio of 40% respectively. Furthermore, by attaching the proposed muscle-like actuators to multiple positions on a wearable anchor, we propose a new soft wearable robot for the wrist named SWA, which is able to assist the 2-DOF motion of the wrist. The fabricated SWA is totally ﬂexible and lightweight. The mass of the wearable parts of the robot was only 151 g. Additionally, the highest torque measured was 1.32 N for wrist extension, while the robot provided a torque of higher than 0.5 Nm for the other wrist motions.
In order to observe the wearability and the ROM of the robot, we conducted user tests on ﬁve healthy male subjects with no impairment in the upper extremity. The average ROM is measured as 33.8, 30.4, 21.4, and 15.4 degrees for ﬂexion, extension, radial deviation, and ulnar deviation. In addition, the wearability of the SWA was observed by measuring the time cost for wearing the device. The self-wearing time is measured as 87 s, and the assistive wearing time is measured as 75 s. The experimental results imply that the SWA can be used routinely to assist patients facing motor impairments at the wrist since it can be worn easily, even when under single hand use.
However, there are some issues that have to be resolved in the design process. Firstly, although we designed the anchor system that prevents the dislocation of the wearable parts, it could not be perfectly prevented. Additional anchoring at the forearm to increase the ﬁxation force can be applied. Secondly, since the size and the shape of the hands and forearms vary from person to person, the force and motion imbalance resulting from the misalignment of the actuators can occur while using the robot. In order to optimize the robot performances for all users, the attachment positions of the actuators should be easily modiﬁed, while having strong ﬁxing force when it is attached. Adopting

locking mechanisms that allow ﬁxing the actuators on the wearable anchor regardless of the attachment position can be considered.
As a future work, we will integrate highly stretchable skin patch-like sensors fabricated using a stretchable polymer and a waved optical ﬁber with the proposed robot to measure its position. Furthermore, the position of the wrist can be possibly controlled by feedback provided from the integrated sensors. Recognizing the intention of the users by adopting intention sensing systems like EMG, force, or ultra-sensitive strain measurement systems will be covered in upcoming studies. We expect that the development of the SWA could be helpful for patients who have diﬃculties in manipulating their lower arm by suggesting a new portable assistive wearable robot that supports the wrist motion in everyday ADL.
