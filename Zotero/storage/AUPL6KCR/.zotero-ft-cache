Abstract: While urban maglev trains have the advantage of being optimized for urban environments where noise is low and dust is less generated, their driving efficiency is low when compared to rotary induction motors owing to the structural limitations of linear devices. To compensate for these disadvantages, various studies on train control schemes have been conducted. Representative control methods include improving the efficiency of using slip frequency by directly controlling the propulsion force using vector control. However, this method has limitations in its use as it relates to the normal force that affects the train’s levitation system. Therefore, in this study, mathematical analysis was conducted for each factor that mutually affects the control of the train. On this basis, the magnitude of the normal force related to the safety of the train is limited. Operating efficiency was improved by varying the slip frequency according to the operating conditions of the train. In addition, for verification, the effect was proved through a comparative experiment using an 18 ton class maglev train running at Incheon International Airport.

1. Introduction
The linear induction motor (LIM) has been widely studied as a transportation system running in urban areas owing to its low noise, environmentally friendly factors that do not generate dust, and its excellent performance on slopes and around sharp curves. An LIM is a system that levitates and is propelled through the interaction of the rails and vehicles using the power of an electromagnet. It comprises, primarily, a levitation system and a propulsion system. In the levitation system, as shown in Figure 1b, the train guide generates an attraction force through the lower part of the rail to levitate the train. As shown in Figure 1a, the propulsion system generates magnetic flux using an electromagnet mounted on the train, linking it to the rail. Subsequently, the linkage magnetic flux generates a counteracting flux in the direction of the train on the rail. Consequently, the train and rail are attracted and repelled by the correlation between the magnetic flux generated by the electromagnet mounted on the train and the counteracting magnetic flux of the rail. The LIM generate thrust for propulsion through attraction and repulsion—a normal force being generated in the rail direction. Therefore, to generate the thrust required to propel the train, a normal force that does not contribute to the propulsion of the train is generated. In addition, because the normal force is generated in the opposite direction of the levitation force of the train, the levitation system must overcome gravity and normal

forces, and float the train. In other words, the unnecessarily generated normal force is a factor that destabilizes the levitation system of the train, it being a potential safety problem due to train levitation failure. It also induces additional energy consumption in both the propulsion system and the levitation system, thereby reducing efficiency [1]. Therefore, for the efficient operation of trains, a train control technique that reflects the characteristics of linear devices is required.

frequency on the basis of the operating conditions of the train to lower the slip frequency while limiting the normal force of the LIM [10]. Second, as a method, an indirect vector control method was proposed that is widely used in rotary induction motors with fast response and excellent performance [11]. However, for indirect vector control, the air-gap magnetic flux must be kept constant, but is difficult to apply in the LIM because the air-gap magnetic flux fluctuates during train operation owing to the characteristics of linear devices. In [12–15], a method was presented using the current of the d axis, which is the axis where the magnetic flux of the motor is generated during the vector control of an induction motor. The attenuated magnetic flux was compensated by controlling d-axis current id. However, this method also had a problem, in that iq associated with the thrust force fluctuated to maintain the slip frequency constant when id was changed to compensate for the attenuated magnetic flux, as shown in slip angular velocity Equation (1) of indirect vector control (here, iq means the current in the q axis generating torque in the d-q axis for vector control):
ωsl = 1

, (1)
where ωsl is the slip angular velocity, Tr = Lr
Rr , Lr is rotor winding impedance, Rr is rotor winding resistance, id is the d-axis current (air-gap magnetic flux), and iq is the q-axis current (thrust). Accordingly, in [16], a control method using both indirect vector control and variable slip-frequency control was proposed. When the id value was changed to compensate for the air-gap magnetic flux, ωsl changed using iq such that the slip value was within the allowable range. However, because this method was not a result derived through mutual mathematical analysis of train operating conditions, it was difficult to guarantee safety because the exact normal force was unknown. In addition, because all input values for each condition must be derived through direct experiments, the process costs much time and money. For this reason, maglev trains currently in operation utilize a fixed slip-frequency control method that can guarantee train safety. Therefore, in order to improve train efficiency while ensuring safety, it is necessary to analyze the mutual influence through mathematical analysis of the slip, normal force, and propulsion force. On the basis of the analyzed data, if the calculated slip frequency is instantaneously changed on the basis of the operating conditions of the train, it is possible to safely and efficiently operate the train (the proposed method increases efficiency by using the ratio of slip frequency, normal force, and traction force, which are the characteristics of electromagnetic-suspension-type LIM. Therefore, it is difficult to apply this method to types of maglev trains with different structures and driving methods). The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the mathematical relationship between normal/propulsion force and slip frequency is analyzed through an investigation of the relationship among normal force, propulsion force, slip, and slip frequency. After that, through the derived equation, the change in efficiency within the limited normal force is presented. Consequently, a control algorithm for controlling the proposed method is presented. In Section 3, the effect is shown through simulation. In Section 4, experimental evaluation conducted using actual vehicles running on the island of Yeongjong, Korea is summarized. Lastly, Section 5 presents our conclusions.
2. Control Method
2.1. Conventional Method
As described above, in a maglev train, both propulsion and normal force fluctuate according to slip. In particular, levitation in the normal force affecting the levitation system of the train becomes a factor that can hinder the safety of the train. Therefore, to control the train, normal force must be controlled by slip. However, because the LIM is a system based on an induction motor and cannot


Energies 2020, 13, 6544 4 of 13
directly control the slip, it was controlled using slip frequency that has a proportional relationship with the slip, as shown in Equation (2):

Table 1 shows that, as the synchronous frequency associated with the train’s synchronous speed decreased, slip increased, maintaining a fixed slip frequency. As shown in Figure 3, as slip increased, vertical force changed in the direction of decreasing, increasing the safety of the train [5,13]. If the slip frequency were fixed, Equation (3) shows that the synchronous speed also had its maximal value at the point where the speed of the train was maximal, and the greatest vertical force occurred at this

Table 1 shows that, as the synchronous frequency associated with the train’s synchronous speed decreased, slip increased, maintaining a fixed slip frequency. As shown in Figure 3, as slip increased, vertical force changed in the direction of decreasing, increasing the safety of the train [5,13]. If the slip frequency were fixed, Equation (3) shows that the synchronous speed also had its maximal value at the point where the speed of the train was maximal, and the greatest vertical force occurred at this moment (here, the maximal synchronous speed was the maximal change speed of the magnetic field generated by the stator when the train was running at maximal speed. The greatest normal force was at the moment when the magnitude of the levitation force that made the levitation system unstable was the greatest), that is, if slip magnitude and the normal force at which the levitation did not fail at the maximal speed of the train, maximal slip frequency could be derived from the synchronous speed of the train. If the derived slip frequency were fixed, the train would be in an area where there was less


Energies 2020, 13, 6544 5 of 13
risk of accidents caused by vertical force when the train is running at full speed. This means that the risk of accidents caused by vertical force would also be low in the section where the speed of the train was decreasing. So, the train could safely run in all speed zones. For train safety, this method is applied to currently running maglev trains. However, this method ignores the train’s operating conditions and uses a fixed slip frequency, which leads to low-efficiency train operation due to large slip at low speeds. Consequently, if the ratio of the fluctuations of the propulsion force and normal force of the train based on the slip frequency is known, the efficiency of the train can be improved by adjusting slip frequency within the normal force that operates safety zones according to the required propulsion force.
2.2. Proposed Method
The equations of normal force and levitation force used in the control of a maglev train can be obtained through FEM analysis [17] and the structural properties of the target vehicle. Equations (4) and (5) show the relationship between normal force and slip frequency, and driving force and slip frequency, respectively:
FN = lτμ0

1 − (RmS)2
(sinhβg)2 + (RmScoshβg)2 (ZmIm)2 (4)
FT = lτμ0
RmS
(sinhβg)2 + (RmScoshβg)2 (ZmIm)2 (5)
where Rm = σtμ0λ f is the magnetic Reynolds number, σt = σte f f is the effective conductivity, te f f is the
effective thickness of the secondary conductor, β = τπ is the air:gap:wavelength ratio, S = 1 − Vm
Vsy = fsl
f
is the slip, Vm is a variable representing the speed of the train, Vsy is a variable representing synchronous speed, Zm is maximal winding density (the maximal winding density per unit length of the train core), Im is the maximal current (the maximal current input for the required current to operate the system), g is the effective void, τ is the pole spacing, f is the power frequency, σ is the conductivity of the secondary conductor, fsl is the slip frequency, and l is the primary core width. By deriving the relational expression between driving force and normal force from the relational expressions in Equations (4) and (5), the ratio of normal force and driving force, as shown in Equation (6), can be derived using the equation related to slip frequency:
FN
FT
= −1
2 (RmS − 1
RmS ) (6)
where Rm = σtμ0λ f and S = fsl
f . From this result, RmS is slip frequency. If this is summarized in terms of slip frequency, it can be expressed as Equations (7) and (8). Through Equation (8), the maximal normal force can be obtained from the currently running fixed slip-frequency value. If this maximal normal force is then substituted for the required thrust, the maximal usable slip frequency range can be calculated for each operating condition. That is, if the normal force and the propulsion force at the maximal propulsion force of a currently running train are substituted, slip frequency can be determined and controlled so as to be limited to a range that does not fail in levitation.

Table 2 uses Figure 4 and Equation (8) to calculate the slip frequency in which the maximal normal force is generated within the range of levitation not failing when propulsion force is changed (if slip

Figure 4. Ratio of normal force and thrust force according to slip frequency.
Table 2 shows that, when the maximal driving force was 100%, when the driving force decreased, the normal force also decreased. Therefore, when using the same slip frequency of 13.5 Hz at approximately 75%, 50%, and 30% thrust, the amount of normal force generated on the basis of maximal thrust is reduced. Assuming that the margin ratio of the normal force is 1 at a slip frequency of 13.5 Hz, margin rates at each operating condition are 1.33, 2, and 3.33, respectively. If slip frequency was lowered by this margin factor, efficient operation would be possible within the range of normal force that did not affect safety. If the optimal slip frequency suitable for train operation conditions were derived in this way, a train-operation pattern capable of varying the appropriate slip frequency during train operation could be obtained.

3. Simulation
In order to perform the simulation under the same conditions as those of the actual train, the data of a train that was actually operated were used as input values, as shown in Figure 6a, through which the current command and slip required for control of the slip frequency was derived and utilized. The black waveform represents the speed pattern of the train, and the blue waveform represents the driving-force waveform of the train. For efficiency comparison, total power consumption and generated normal force were compared between the conventional method using a slip frequency of 13.5 Hz, and the proposed method in which the slip frequency fluctuated during train operation based on the operating conditions. In the proposed method, the margin rate of the limited normal force was set to vary between 9.5 and 13.5 Hz according to the applied operating conditions.

3. Simulation
In order to perform the simulation under the same conditions as those of the actual train, the data of a train that was actually operated were used as input values, as shown in Figure 6a, through which the current command and slip required for control of the slip frequency was derived and utilized. The black waveform represents the speed pattern of the train, and the blue waveform represents the driving-force waveform of the train. For efficiency comparison, total power consumption and generated normal force were compared between the conventional method using a slip frequency of 13.5 Hz, and the proposed method in which the slip frequency fluctuated during train operation based on the operating conditions. In the proposed method, the margin rate of the limited normal force was set to vary between 9.5 and 13.5 Hz according to the applied operating conditions.

Figure 7 compares the results of the existing control method and the proposed method. Figure 7a shows the accumulated power consumption while the train was running. The existing control method of the red curve consumed approximately 140 Wh of power while operating under the same conditions and section, whereas the proposed method of the black curve consumed approximately 116 Wh of power, an improvement of approximately 24 Wh, which is a reduction in power consumption and an efficiency improvement of approximately 19.6%. Figure 7b shows the normal force change during train operation. When a margin ratio of approximately 30% was compensated for safety from the actual train’s limited normal force, the limit value was about −2.5 kN, called the critical normal force. If the normal force falls below this value, levitation fails. Looking at the waveform in Figure 7b, the maximal generated normal force of the conventional method was −2.04 kN, and the maximal generated normal force of the proposed method was −2.45 kN. Both systems were in the safe area. Therefore, when using the proposed method, efficiency increased by approximately 17.14%, but it was confirmed that the efficiency improvement of the proposed method was effective because the train was running within a safe range of normal force.

5. Conclusions
In this study, as part of our research on improving the operating efficiency of a maglev train using an LIM, the relationship between train slip frequency, normal force, and propulsion force was analyzed through a mathematical study. Using the analytical results, the slip frequency having the optimal efficiency was derived on the basis of the train’s operating conditions while limiting the normal force to the extent to which the levitation system of the train did not fail. Subsequently, slip frequency was changed according to the operating conditions of the train in real time. Through the ATO driving system, a simulation test in which slip frequency was varied on the basis of the driving conditions of the train while it was running, and an experiment using an actual train were conducted. As a result of the simulation test for one operating section in which the actual train was running, when the proposed method was used rather than the existing fixed system slip frequency of 13.5 Hz, a cumulative power-consumption decrease of approximately 24 Wh and an efficiency gain of approximately 17.14% were achieved. These results confirmed that the efficiency improvement using the proposed method was significant. In the case of the experiment, when the proposed method was compared with the existing fixed system slip frequency of 13.5 Hz, the cumulative power consumption decreased by


Energies 2020, 13, 6544 12 of 13
approximately 6.78 kWh and efficiency increased by approximately 12.2%. Through this, we verified that the proposed method is more efficient than the existing method is (the proposed method uses LIM characteristics, which are suitable for low- and medium-speed types. Therefore, it is difficult to apply to maglev trains with different structures and principles, such as superconducting-repulsion or permanent-magnet types).
