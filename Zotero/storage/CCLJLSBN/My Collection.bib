Pathologically, this case showed multiple necrotising gastroenteritis ulcers, the death of large numbers of hepatocytes and multiple instances of chronic active interstitial nephritis. Entamoeba invadens and Aeromonas hydrophila were frequently found in these lesions. Confirmation of these pathogens was made using molecular and phylogenetic analyses. The TUNEL assay revealed the apoptotic nature of hepatocyte cell death.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a shape memory alloy (SMA)-based wearable robot that assists the wrist motion for patients who have difficulties in manipulating the lower arm. Since SMA shows high contraction strain when it is designed as a form of coil spring shape, the proposed muscle-like actuator was designed after optimizing the spring parameters. The fabricated actuator shows a maximum force of 10 N and a maximum contraction ratio of 40%. The SMA-based wearable robot, named soft wrist assist (SWA), assists 2 degrees of freedom (DOF) wrist motions. In addition, the robot is totally flexible and weighs 151g for the wearable parts. A maximum torque of 1.32 Nm was measured for wrist flexion, and a torque of larger than 0.5 Nm was measured for the other motions. The robot showed the average range of motion (ROM) with 33.8, 30.4, 15.4, and 21.4 degrees for flexion, extension, ulnar, and radial deviation, respectively. Thanks to the soft feature of the SWA, time cost for wearing the device is shorter than 2 min as was also the case for patients when putting it on by themselves. From the experimental results, the SWA is expected to support wrist motion for diverse activities of daily living (ADL) routinely for patients.},

abstract = {Magnetic bearings support rotors in a non-contact way using magnetic force. Therefore, there is no friction and it is possible to measure and control the position of a rotor in the air gap. In this study, the rotational vibration of a roller was minimized using magnetic bearings, and a precision roller capable of automatic alignment using the position control function of magnetic bearings was proposed. A rotation accuracy of approximately 4.6 $\mu$m (peak-to-peak) was observed, even under a rotation of 30 rev/min and a radial force load of 300 N. The rotor position control experiment for magnetic bearings showed that 1-$\mu$m resolution position control is possible. To further improve the accuracy, the automatic alignment algorithm was proposed using magnetic bearings for the roller misalignment condition, and it was confirmed that alignment is possible at a level that the pressing force difference between both ends of the roller is within 0.3 N. Through this study, it was confirmed that rollers with magnetic bearings can be applied to precision equipment. It is expected that the implementation of the automatic alignment function will simplify the equipment configuration and maintenance compared to conventional rollers with ball bearings.},

abstract = {A suit-type wearable robot (STWR) is a new type of soft wearable robot (SWR) that can be worn easily anywhere and anytime to assist the muscular strength of wearers because it can be worn like normal clothes and is comfortable to wear even with no power supply. This paper proposes an STWR, in which a shape-memory-alloy-based fabric muscle (SFM) is used as the actuator. The STWR, which weighs less than 1 kg, has a simple structure, with the following components: SFMs, wire encoders for measuring the contraction length of the SFMs, and BOA that fix the actuators on the forearms. In this study, a position controller for the SFM using the wire encoder was developed, and a prototype STWR was fabricated using this position controller. Moreover, by putting the STWR on a mannequin, step-response experiments were performed in which the arms of the mannequin lifted barbells weighing 2 kg and 4 kg to a certain target position. A fast response of moving to the target position in less than 1 s was observed in all steps except for the initial heating step for the 2 kg barbell. The response speed of the SFM was noticeably slower for the 4 kg barbell compared to that for the 2 kg barbell; it moved to the target position in approximately 3 s in all the steps except for the initial heating step. The SFM-applied STWR could overcome the limitations of conventional robots in terms of weight and inconvenience, thereby demonstrating the application potential of STWRs.},

abstract = {Magnetic bearings are oil-free bearings that are widely employed in turbo machineries such as turbo refrigerant compressors in order to eliminate lubrication systems, avoid contamination, and increase efficiency. We have developed a 145 refrigerant ton (RT)-class turbo refrigerant compressor using homopolar-type radial hybrid magnetic bearings (HMBs) and thrust magnetic bearings. The thrust magnetic bearing comprises a thrust HMB and a permanent magnet that generate downward forces to overcome high upward thrust forces of 2000 N at 21{\^{a}} ‰ 000 rpm. A test rig and controller for the compressor with magnetic bearings were fabricated, and rotordynamics such as the unbalance response and axial displacement were investigated. Rotordynamics analyses using the finite element method predicted that the 1st bending mode is located at a high frequency with sufficient margin from the operating speeds. Further, the zero-to-peak displacement caused by the unbalanced response was sufficiently small. The rotor was stably supported with few vibrations across the entire range of the operational speeds. Our results demonstrate that the advantages of oil-free bearings can be easily exploited in turbo machineries such as turbo refrigerant compressors by adopting HMBs. {\textcopyright} 2014 AFM, EDP Sciences .},

abstract = {Recently, high capacity and high efficiency turbo machines such as turbo blowers and turbo compressors have been being developed. To keep up with this trend, magnetic bearings are increasingly being applied to turbo machines instead of air foil bearings. In this study, a hybrid magnetic bearing composed of a permanent magnet and an electromagnet was applied to 300- HP(horsepower) turbo compressors with rated speeds of 50,000 rpm. The length of the shaft should be reduced as short as possible so that the compressor rotor can rotate stably while maintaining a small vibration at a rotation speed of 50,000 rpm. In this study, the additional shaft length for the axial gap sensor is eliminated by applying a new layout in which the axial gap sensor is placed on the inner surface of the thrust magnetic bearing. No-load tests and full-load tests in the manufactured turbo compressors were performed to evaluate the performance of the designed magnetic bearings. The biggest obstacle to this development is the heat problems caused by compressor impellers and high-speed motors. Thanks to the cooling system using water and air, the problem of thermal expansion of the rotor in the axial direction can be avoided. Thrust forces were estimated using the control current for thrust magnetic bearings. The experiment is also performed to evaluate the vibration of each turbo compressor and the results are presented. Based on the evaluated vibration, it has been confirmed that the hybrid magnetic bearings and the new axial gap sensor layout can support the turbo compressors stably.},
