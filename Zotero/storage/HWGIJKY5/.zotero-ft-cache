Preface
The field of control engineering has provided valuable theoretical
contributions to advancements in Robotics. Aspects of control engineering
which have been utilized include: linear systems theory, mulLivariable control ,
adaptive control and nonlinear control. The need for further development and research in these and related areas is apparent when new applications and more
stringent performance criteria are encountered. In fact, some fundamental and
somewhat rudimentary issues have not yet been resolved. The simplest and most common compensation technique for industrial
robots is the PID type controller. In general, this control ler is designed with the
assumption of independent manipUlator joint dynam ics, thus its performance is
limited because manipulators arc n degrcc-of-freedom coupled nonlinear
dynamic systems. The PID controllers, however, are generally designed and
easily implemented for single-input!single-output plants. Although the overall system's performance using these controllers may not be acceptable, this
method has been proven to guarantee global stability of robot manipulators and
can kad to acceptable performance in some cases. To improve the
performance, feedforward compensation has been introduced to effectively
correct for tracking errors. This approach works reasonably well when the plant
parameters have been identified correctly. In order to maintain acceptable
responses in the face of changing parameters or loads. adaptive control schemes
have been used to fe-tunc the controller gains continuously. Also, several other
schemes have been proposed for the control of robot manipulators.
The performance of a system, however, does not depend on the control
system design alone. An appropriate match between system hardware design
and controller design is a key issue, particularly when high performance is required. Thus, in the design of machines for advanced applications,
fundamental physical understanding should refleet all aspects of the control
system incl uding those relevant to mechanical design. The unification of
theoretical work with mechanical design is necessary to improve system
hardware and ultimately to permit "exact" execution of the control actions.
These considerations are of great importance in the development of precision positioning robots for submicron assembly operations. and high speed high


Jccuracy manipulators for trajectory control. For example, in certJin laser
cUlling applications the end effector speed, acceleration and tracking tolerance
are on the order of 3 mis, 3 to 5 G and 0.05 mm respectively. Thus, the
hardware for such applications must be properly engineered to meet these
severe control specifications.
The gap between mechanical design and control is gradually closing.
Advancements in control engineering have contributed strongly to the merging
of these fundamental issues, and the development of a unified approach to robot
design and control. The goal of this book is to present such a unified approach
to design and control in the development of high performance robot
manipulators -- this text is intended to provide not only theoretical
fundamentals needed for analysis and synthesis but also practical hardware
implementations in direct-drive robot technology.
This book is organized into four parts: Direct-Drive Technologies, Arm
Design Theory. Development of M.I.T. Direct-Drive Manipulators, and
Supporting Articles.
Chapter 1 of this book starts with a historical perspective in robot design,
then presents the direct-drive concept Description of several direct-drive
robots is given as an overview for the state-of-the-art in this technology. This
includes a few models that were designed at the M.I.T. Laboratory for
Manufacturing and Productivity, Carnegie-Mellon University and industrial
companies that have produced products which usc this concept.
The robot components; such as motors, drive amplifiers, sensors and arm
linkages; are covered in Chapter 2. More importantly, the issues in arm design
and control are also discussed in this chapler.
Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6 deal with ann design theory. They introduce
analytical tools for evaluation of the static characteristics of manipulators and
new approaches in the design of manipulators with simplified dynamics.
The development of the M.I.T. direct-drive robot for high speed trajectory
control is presented in chapters 7 and 8. These chapters cover not only the design of the mechanism but also the control system design.
The last part of this book presents some supporting articles relevant to the design and control of direct-drive manipulators.

Introduction
1.1 Historical Perspectives of Robot Design
In the early 1960's, Unimation Inc., in Danbury, Connecticut, made the
first successful installation of what we call an industrial robOl today. Their
robot was a flvc-axis, hydraulically driven manipulator ann cnpable of carrying
a several-pound payload along a predetermined path. After a careful task analysis. their robots were installed for the loading and unloading of workpicccs
for dicasting machines. The task involved repetitive, tedious work in a dirty.
noisy and dangerous environment The robot, capable of repeating instructed
motions. mel the increasing requirement for the replacement of unpleasant
manual operations.
The mechanical construction of the first Unimate industrial robot departed
from traditional machine design in many ways. The arm was basically a
cantilevered beam structure with many degrees of freedom, most of which were
revolute joints that formed a closed kinematic chain. This structure allows the robot to perform flexible motions and aceess a large work space compared with
the space occupied by the robot itself. Also, the robot arm can operate in a
crowded area as we have seen in most factory environments. Thus, the open
kinematic chain meets the high mobility and flexibility requirements in the
kinematic structure design. However, this kinematic structure created a number
of difficult machine design problems. The positioning accuracy at the endpoint
of the long cantilevered arm is considerably low; and the mechanical stiffness
of the arm construction is inherenLly poor as well. Also, a small amount of
error at each revol ute joint is magnified at the arm's endpoint as the arm length
gets longer. As a result, the required accuracy for the actuator driving the
revolute joint must be significantly high for the articulated arm. The hydraulic
actuators used for the first Unimate robot were a reasonable choice because of
the high performance required for Lhc drive system. Hydraulic drives are
generally high precision, high power actuators with particularly high torquc-to
weight ratio. In consequence, hydraulic robots arc capable of accurate motions


2 Direct-Drive Robots
under severe load conditions. As applications of industrial robots expanded. different types of robots were developed to meet a variety of task requirements. For light-duty applications, electrically-powered robots became the most prominent robot design. In arc weldin g, for example, electrical robots arc most widely used. Compared with hydraulic drives. electro-mechanical drives are, generally, inexpensive and clean. as well as easy to maintain. Thus, electrical robots continue to replace hydraulic robots in many applications.
Electrical motors generally produce their maximum power at high speed. In other words, the electrical motors exert rather small torques while rotati ng at high speeds. In consequence, appropriate gearing is necessary for the electrical motors in order for these systems to drive such loads. Robot arms arc usually moved at low speeds, less than one revolution per second, while required maximum torques range from a few newton-melers to several hundred newton meters. A large gear reduction on the order of 1:100 is typically required for
sk'mdard servo motors.
Design of electro-mechanical drives is complicated by the need for gearing and reducers. The reducer must provide a high gear reduction while maintaining high precision. Particularly important is that the reducer should not introduce backlash or lost motion, which will directly degrade positioning accuracy. Even a small amount of backlash at a proximal joint leads to a
significantly large error at the arm tip. Hence. backlash must be completely
eliminated at each joint. Friction is another problem in the design of gearing. As described later. anti-backlash gears and other types of reducers with low backlash are characterized by considerably large friclion. In many cases the motor power dissipated at the gearing amounts to over 30% of the total power because of the large friction. The large friction also leads to poor control accuracy, which is a more serious problem for high precision applications. Friction is an unpredictable characteristic, and is difficult to identify, hence difficult to compensate for.
Gearing mechanisms are often major sources of mechanical deflections or compliances. Poor m echanical stiffness not only causes static arm deflections but also limits dynamic responses. The loop gain of the servo system cannot be increased if the higher order delay resulting from the low stiffness makes the
system unstable. This severely limits the bandwidth and accuracy of the drive
system . Poor stiffness at the gearing may also cause undesirable vibrations.


Chapter 1 3
This vibration {>roblcm is a critical issue {>articularly for high speed
manipulation. After arriving at a spccificd point, the robot cannot proceed to
the following step of motion, until the residual vibration caused by the gearing
compliance ceases. Thus, the reduced mechanical stiffness is a crucial problem
when the tact time of operations is short.
Traditionally, speed and accuracy are main issues in the de sign of
machines. Robots are, however, somewhat di fferent in that the speed and
accuracy are not necessarily the primary goal of de sign. Essential robot
charactcristics are described by such words as flexibility, dexterity, intelligence,
etc. Consequently, much research effort has addressed issues regarding how
robots can be more flexible, dexterous and intclligent.
In advanced manipulation tasks. such as assembly of mechanical parts,
robots perfonn the task through mechanical interactions with the environment.
The robot is required to accommodate contact forces as well as to control the
location of its end effector. Force control and compliance control arc then
necessary for those tasks which require control of mechanical interactions.
Control schemes such as these, have been implemented on traditional robots
that were primarily designed as positioning devices. The drive systems of these
devices are basically position-controlled, and arc not necessarily appropriate for
force control. Reducers in electro-mechanical drives create significantly large
friction , which provides disturbance torques in the force control system and
degrades the control perfonnance. It is also difficult for a hydraulic robot to
control delicate interaction forces between the arm tip and the environment.
Thus, we need an appropriate hardware tool for delicate force control and
advanced manipulation.
1.2 The Direct-Drive Approach
Direct-drive is, basically, an electrical drive in which no gear reducer is
used. The rotor of an electrical motor is directly coupled to the load. hence the
mechanical gearing is completely eliminated. The direct-drive robot is defined
to be a mechanical arm where all or part of the active arm joints are actuated with the direct drive.
Figure 1-1 shows the basic construction of a direct-drive joint from a
direct-drive robot The direct-drive joint consists of a pair of arm links, the
motor. and the bearings. The motor is comprised of the stator and the rotor.


4 DireCI·Dri�·e Robots
The stator is housed in the case connected to one of the arm links, usually a
proximal link, and the rotor is directly coupled to the joint shaft, which is
connected to the other ann link, usually a distal link. Thus the distal arm link is
rotated directly by the torque exerted between the rotor and the stator, hence
direct drive.
The problems that the mechanical gcaring unavoidably possesses can be
solved completely in the direct drive method. Backlash is completely removed
and friction is reduced significantly. It may exist only at the bearings
supporting the joint shaft. The mechanical construction can be much stiffer
than drive mechanisms with gcaring, wear of gcars is no longer troublesome.
and the simple construction is more reliable and is easy to maintain.
These features may result in excellent control performance. The accuracy
of positioning can be improved remarkably. Since the simple mechanical
construction possesses less uncertainties, ego low friction and no backlash, the
repeatability of positioning can be an order of magnitude better than that of the
gcared drives. The simplified mechanism will also allow us to identify the
system dynamics with little difficulty. The behavior of the drive system can be
modeled accurately, and thus the dynamic response is more predictable. These
desirable static and dynamic characteristics make it easy and effective to apply
advanced control schemes including force control and compliant motion
control. Thus the direct-drive robot can be a desirable test bed for advanced
manipulation studies.
1.3 The State of the Art of Direct-Drive Robots
The basic concept of a direct-drive robot was first established by H. Asada
in 1980. He and his colleague T. Kanade developed the first prototype in 1981
at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie-Mellon University. Photo 1-1 shows their
robot, CMU D-D Arm Model I, a six degree-or-freedom manipulator arm
consisting of all direct-drive revolute joints. The first joint, the most proximal
joint at the ceiling, causes a rotation about the vertical axis, while the second
joint rotates the upper arm about a horizontal axis. The third joint rotates the
forcann about the center line of the upper ann . The motor driving the third
joint is fixed to the upper ann and is located on the other side of the elbow part,
so that the motor acts as a counterweight of the elbow parL. The gravity load of
the second motor is then reduced with this mass balancing procedure. The

fourth joint is the elbow, causing the bending motion of the forearm, while the
fifth joint rotates the forearm about its center line. The motor of the fifth joint
is located within the elbow part, so that the load of the fourth motor can be
reduced. The last joint is at the wrist part, bending the arm tip about the axis
perpendicular to the forearm.
The motors used for the first three joints arc DC torque motors using
ALNICO magnets at the stators. The maximum torque of the largest motor,
that is, the first motor, is over 150 Nm, while the diameter of the stator is 60
cm. The motors of the last three joints are also DC torque motors, but the
permanent m agnets used are Samarium-Cobalt magnets, which are more than
three times stronger than the ALNICO magnet in terms of maximum magnetic
energy product.
The first prototype development at the CMU Robotics Institute
demonstrated the potential advantages and feasibility of the direct drive
approach. The prototype design, however, revealed that the robot of this new
type needs more powerful motors with more compact sizes. The motors used
for the CMU Arm are not sufficient to drive the large loads, while the size of
each motor is so large that the arm construction becomes too bulky and heavy.
At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, improved direct-drive robots
were developed by H. Asada and K. Youccf-Toumi. The motors used for the
M.I.T. Arms are brushless DC torque motors with Samarium-Cobalt magnets,
which can exert 3 to 10 times larger torque compared with the CMU Arm. For
example, the largest motor of one of the M.I.T. arms can produce 660 Nm of
output torque, while its slator diameter is only 35cm. In comparison with the
largest motor of the CMU Arm, the peak torque is therefore 3 times larger,
while the diameter reduces to a half of the previous motor.
Photo 1-2, shows the M.I.T. D-D Arm Model I , a three degree-of
freedom, serial link manipulator arm. The arm was built during the period 1982
to 1983, and is currently installed at M.I.T.'s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
The robot has a unique kinematic structure, which allows it to eliminate gravity
loads at individual motors. The first joint rotates the whole upper body about
the vertical axis, hence no gravity load acts upon the first motor. The second
joint rotates the forearm about the center line of the upper arm, similar to the
third joint of the eMU Arm • but the motion of the upper arm is constrained
within a horizontal plane. The third joint is located at the elbow. and causes the
bending motion of the forearm. Since the mass of the forearm is balanced with
its counterweight, the third motor docs not experience any gravity load •

Similarly, the axis of the second joint passes through the centroid of the
foreann, hence no gravity load acts on the second molor. Thus all three motors
have no gravity load for all arm configurations.
Photo 1-3 shows the M.I.T. D-D Arm Model II, which was developed by
the same group at M.I.T. from 1983 through 1984. For this arm, they employed
a parallel drive mechanism with a closed-loop kinematic chain. The upper two
motors, located on the base frame, drive the two input links of the parallelogram
mechanism, which causes a two degrcc-of-freedom vertical motion at the arm
tip. One of the features of this arm construction is that the heavy mOlor at the
elbow joint of the previous model was replaced by the mOlar mounted on the
base frame and that the drive torque is transmitted through the parallelogram
mechanism. This remote drive mechanism reduces the arm weight significantly
and improves the dynamic performances. Another feature of the Model II D-D
Arm is the innovative technique for dynamic mass balancing and deeoupling,
which arc to be discussed in detail in Chaplers 4 and 5.
As the velocity of the arm motion increased, the dynamic characteristics of
the arm construction have more critical influence upon thc control pcrfonnancc.
Photo 1-4 shows thc M.I.T. D-D Arm Model III with a linkage made out of
graphitc composite material. Since the material is lightweight and strong, the
arm's stiffness as well as the inertia are improved significantly. The natural
frequency of the arm construction wa s then increased to about 70 Hz, whereas
the Model II Ann, which was made of aluminum, had a natural frequency of
only 14 Hz. With this lightweight, high stiffness arm structure, the M.I.T. D·D
Arm Model III has achieved an extremely fast motion: The maximum tip speed
is 12 mls and the maximum acceleration is over 5 G.
Photo 1-5 shows another type of dircct-drive ann developed at M.I.T., the
M.LT. D-D Arm model IV. The two motors aligned on a vertical axis drive the
horizontal parallelogram mcchanism. Since the link motion is constrained
within a horizontal plane, no gravity load acts upon the two motors. Robots
with this lype of kinematic construction arc often referred to as SCARA robots ,
which arc widely used for assembly operations, particularly for planar assembly
tasks.
The simple constructio n of the SCARA robot is appropriate for direct
drive robots: small number of degrees of freedom as wen as the no- gravity
load construction make it easier to build practical robots. In facl, the first
commercialized direct·drive robot employed the same kinematic construction as
the SCARA robot. Photo 1-6 shows the AdeplOne direct·drive robot developed

by ADEPT Technology Inc., at Sunnyvale, California, in 1983. The arm has
four degrees of freedom. Two motors are located at the base, which produce
the horizontal link motion. The other two motors are on the forearm: one drives
the lead screw which produces a translational motion along the vertical axis, while the other rotates the gripper about the vertical axis.
To reduce the ann weight, some of the joints are driven remotely by
motors located at proximal positions. The second joint. that is the elbow joint,
is driven by one of the base motors through a steel band between the motor and
the elbow joint. The wrist joint is driven by a motor at the elbow position
through another steel band. Though transmission mechanisms are used. no gear
reducers are employed in this arm design. In consequence. the features of the
direct-drive approach are mostly maintained.
The maximum speed of the arm is 9 mls. which is defined to be the tip
speed when all the joints are at slew speed. The repeatability. that is. the
maximum positioning error when reaching the same destination along the same trajectory. is determined to be ± 0.001 inch or ± 0.0254 mm. Both
specifications are an order-of-magnitude better than traditional robots with gear
reducers.
The motors used for the AdeptOne direct-drive robot are specially
designed high torque motors produced by Motometics Inc. in Santa Rosa.
California. As described in detail in the following chapter, the motor is a
3-phase variable reluctance motor having many teeth at the roLOr. The motor produces a large torque with small power consumption. when rotating at low
speeds.
Photo 1-7 shows another direct-drive robot commercialized by the
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd., Osaka. Japan. The robot has the same
kinematic construction as that of the M.I.T. Arm Model IV, namely the
horizontal parallelogram mechanism. The arm length is about 60 cm, a little
smaller than the AdeptOne robot. The motors used for the Matsushita robot arc
brushless torque motors with Samarium-Cobalt magnets. One of the features
of the Matsushita robot is that the motor, when incorporated with a high
pcrfonnance drive amplifier. has an excellent linearity. while producing a large
torque with a small torque ripple. This allows us to improve the control
accuracy not only positioning control but also for the torque control. One can
also change the endpoint compliance in a wide range; it can be extremely soft or
hard by simply changing the gains of the drive system.
Another feature of the Matsushita robot is its high accuracy. Precision

position sensors were specially developed for the direct-drive robots. The
sensor is a laser interferometer type e ncoder, having a high resolution. With
this encoder and the motor drive system, the repeatability of the Matsushita
robot is less than ± 0.010 mm or ± 0.0004 inch. This will meet increasing
needs for high accuracy operations, particulary in precision assemblies of
electric parts.
Photo 1-8 shows a larger size direct-drive robot used for the laser cutting
of sheet metal. The robot was developed by the Shin Meiwa Industry Ltd., in
Japan. A laser beam passes inside the arm links, changes its direction at the
arm joints and impinges against a sheet metal part. The speed and accuracy of
the metal cutting are dependent upon the performance of the robot used. The
direct-drive robot is capable of tracing a complex spacial curve at a high speed
while maintaining high accuracy. In laser cutting it is particularly difficult to
move around a sharp comer or to trace a circular curve of small radi us, because
an extremely large acceleration is required for the robot. Shin Meiwa's direct
drive laser cutting robot has a maximum acceleration of over 5 G at the arm tip.
To achieve the extremely high acceleration, the arm links arc made of
graphite composite, which reduces the arm weight and increases natural
frequencies. A special dynamic mass balancing technique was employe d in the
arm linkage design. Thcse techniques used for both robots by Shin Mciwa and
Matsushita will be discussed in detail in Part II of the book.
Thus research and development of direct-drive robots have been conducted
both in industry and in aeadcmia during the past scveral years. It ranges from
the development of components, such as motors and sensors, to the
development of arm design and necessary control theory. The following
chapters investigate the component technologies fust, and then diseuss the
design and control problems of the direct-drive arms.

Chapter 2
Drive Systems
2.1 Introduction
Key components in the design and control of a direct-drive robot are the
motors and drive amplifiers. An order of magnitude larger torque must be generated in a compact and lightweight body. F1uctualions in torque Dnd speed
should be minimized in order to achieve accurDtc control. There arc many othcr
requirements for motors used for the dircct-drive robot. In this section we
analyze the characteristics of motors and discuss some performance standards,
which are critical to the direct-drive robot applications. Motors used in direct drive robots are: 1. Direct current torque motors,
2. Brushless D.C. torque motors ,
3. Variable reluctance motors.
We investigate each type of the direct-drive motors and compare their
performances.
2.2 Direct Current Torque Motors
2.2.1 Design
Direct current mOlors arc the simplest but most highly efficient motors
widely used for robot drives. To apply the D.C. mOlor to the direct drive robot,
the motor design must be modified so that a sufficiently large torque can be
obtained. The motors used in the early versions of direcl·drive rObots, c.g. eMU Direct-Drive Arm • arc referred to as D.C. torque motors, or D.C. torquers. which arc capable of exerting much larger torques compared with regular D.C.
motors. There is, however. no essential difference between regular D.C. motors
and the direct-drive D.C. motor in principle; the latter motor is designed in such
a way llIat the output torque. ralller than power, be maximized.


20 Direct·Dri)'e Robots
As shown in Photo 2·1, a typical D.C. torque motor consists of a stator, a
rotor and a brush ring. The stator is made of pcnnanent magnets cemented on a
metal ring, while the rotor has windings having many poles on it. The torque is
exerted at the air gap between the rotor and the stator. The total area of the air
gap A is detennined by the product of the length of the rotor, L" and the
diameter of the air gap cylinder, which is approximately the same as the rotor
diame�r, D"
(2,1)
The output torque is then determined! by the air gap area and the rotor diameter,
(2.2)
where ka is a constant determined by the magnetic field at the air gap times the
current flowing into the windings. Thus the output torque is proportional to the
square of the rotor diameter. Therefore a straightforward way of increasing the
torque is to enlarge the rotor diameter rather than increasing the rotor length .
This is why the direct-drive torque motor in Photo 2-1 has a large diameter and
a short rotor length, which looks like a pancake.
2.2.2 The Torque Constant
The dynamic equation of the D.C. torque motor is the same as that of a regular D.C. motor. The electrical relationship of the armature is given by
V=Ri+E+L di
dl (2.3)
where V is the voltage applied to the armature, Rand L are the resistance and
the inductance of the windings, respectively, j is the current, and E is the back
emf, which is given by
E=K,OO (2.4)
where Kl is called back e.m.r constant, and 00 is the angular velocity of the


Chapler2 21
Photo 2-1: D.C. torque molor


22 Direct-Drb'e Robots
rotor.
The electrical power converted into mechanical power is given by P=Ei,
that is, the voltage drop due to the back emf times the armature current. This
amount of power is the same as the mechanical power proouced by the rotor:
Ei='too (2.5)
Substituting Equ. (2.4) into Equ. (2.5), we obtain the relationship between the
torque and the current
(2 .6)
where K/ is called torque constant, which is the same number as the back emf
constant when SI units are used.
The torque constant is determined by the magnetic field and the
geometrical parameters of the air gap. For an ideal torque motor, the torque
constant is truly invariant. However in reality, it varies with the rotor position.
Since the magnetic field consists of discrete poles and the commutation occurs
discretely, the torque constant varies as the rotor rotates. This causes
fluctuations in the output torque. The amount of fluctuation is represented by
the torque ripple, which is the ratio of the torque deviation to the average of the
output torque. The torque ripple is an important pcrfomance standard for the
dircct drive application, because the torque fluctuations prevent smooth
motions, particularly at slow speeds, and degrade control accuracy.
To minimize the torque ripple. the rotor windings arc divided into a
number of coil pieces that arc connected to the same number of commutator
segments. The current is then switched from one coil to another more
smoothly. The number of poles at the stator is also increased in order to
smoothen the magnetic field.
2.2.3 The Motor Constant
Another important performance standard is concerned with the power
performance necessary for exerting torque. Let us consider a stall condition in
which the motor docs not rotate while exerting a torque, The power consumed
inside the motor is evaluated by using Equs. (2.3) and (2.6), so that


Chapter 2 23
(2.7)
or
(2.8)
where the constant Km is given by
(2.9)
As shown in Equ. (2.7) the output torque is proportional to the square root of the power consumed. The proportionality constant, Km, accounts for the efficiency of the torque motor in terms of the transduction of clectric power to mechanical torque. The highcr the constant is, the larger the exerted torque becomes, and the lower the power consumed. The constant is referred to as the
motor constant -- one of the maj or specifications of a direct-drive motor.
Let us also consider a steady-state condition when the molor is rotating at a
constant angular velocity ro. From Equs. (2.2), (2.3), (2.5) and (2.8), we obtain
K, 2
't=-V-K ro

Figure 2-1 plots the above torque-speed characteristics for a given armature voltage. The squared motor constant, Km2, designates the ncgative slope of the charactcristies curve. The negative slope accounts for a natural damping efrect, which results from the back emf. The negative slope contributes a stabilizing effect to the system.
When rotating at a constant speed ro, the motor produces the mechanical power Pm given by

(2.11)
which takes a maximum for a given armature voltage V. As shown in Figure 2-1, the power is maximum at half the maximum speed and at half the maximum torque. This provides the optimum operating condition, in which the motor can exert its maximum power. As the operating condition of the torque and speed departs from the optimum point, the efficiency declines along the parabolic curve. Note that for a larger motor constant, the optimal point moves towards the lower speed, since the maximun speed decreases for a fixed armature voltage V. Direct-drive motors are generally operated at low speeds, and in consequence a larger motor constant is desired in order to improve the efficiency.
2.2.4 The Electric Time Constant
Next we consider dynamic performances, particularly the response of the output torque to a sudden change of the armature voltage V. From Equs. (2.3) and (2.6), the Laplace transform of the motor torque is
where Te is referred to as the electric time constant and is given by
L
T
=
eR
(2.12)
(2.13)
The electric time constant is neglibly small for most D.C. motors, but it isn't for
direct-drive torque motors. To generate a large torque, the direct-drive motor needs a large rotor diameter and larger windings, which possess, unavoidably, a large inductance. It is of special importance for the motor drive system to cope with the significant effect of the large electric time constant so that the control system can be stable.


26 Direct-Dri�'e Robots
2.3 Brushlcss D.C. Torque Motors
2.3.1 Principle
The D.C. torque motors. investigated in the previous section, have many
advantages including high efficiency • low torque ripple, linear torque-speed
characteristics, and simplicity of construction.
A major drawback of the D.C. torque motor is that large currents arc
delivered to the rotor through mechanical commutation. At the brush and
commutator , large sparks arc created beca use of the large inductance at the
rotor windings as well as the large currents and high voltages supplied to the
rotor windings. The large sparks arc harmful , causing the brush to wear
quickly. Such a large spark also produces unwanted noise. which is harmful to
oLher electrical devices. The brush mecbanism increases mechanical friction,
which degrades control performances.
The MIT Direct-Drive Arms and other c ommercialized robots employed
brushless D.C. torque motors . In the brushless motor. the mechanical
commutation is replaced by electric switching circuits. so that the mechanical
brush can be eliminated. No sparks are then produced. while the features of the
conventional D.C. motors are mostly preserved. The efficiency is as high as the
conventional D.C. motors, and the torque-speed characteristics arc linear in a
wide range of speeds.
Unlike the conventional D.C. motors, the rotor of the brushless molor
consists of permanent magnets. while the stator consists of windings (as shown
in Figure 2-2). Thus the rotor and the stator are interchanged. The commutation
of currents is accomplished by measuring the rotor position using a position
sensor. In accordance with the rotor position, currents are delivered to
appropriate windings through electronic switching circuits.
As mentioned in the previous seclion, the conventi onal D.C. torquer has
many coil pieces and the same number of commutator segments , so that the
torque ripple can be suprcssed. If, in the brushless mOlor, an individual
electronic switch is used for each of the coil pieces, the drive amplifier becomes
complex and costly. having many expensive switching transistors. Therefore,
the number of independent switches is minimized in the brushless mOlor -- a
common construction of the windings is that of a three-phase mOlor, as shown
in Figure 2-3. This winding construction requires only independent switches,
each of them is to draw a current into the winding at appropriate locations of the

rotor. A problem with this motor design is that the torque may change
discontinuously when the switches are turned on and off as the rotor position changes. To reduce such a torque ripple. the current flowing into each winding is varied continuously with the rotor motion. Let lA' In and Ie be individual currents flowing into the three phase windings. Let them vary so that:

(2.14)
where 8rot represents the rotor position and 10 is some desired motor current. The torque exerted by the motor is given by
(2.15)
The first term accounts for the contribution by the windings of phase A, and the
second and the third terms by the phase B and C windings. respectively. The motor torque t is then obtained by substituting Equ. (2.14) into Equ. (2.15), and is given by
(2.16)
The above equation indicates a linear relationship between the output torque and the motor current. In practice, this relationship may not be linear.
The torque current characteristics of a brushless motor are virtually the same as
those of a DC motor. Specifically. the torque constant and motor constant can be defined in the same way as was discussed previously. The choice of the phase currents given by Equ. (2.14) is implemented using ROM's and


30 Direct-Drive Robots
multiplying D/A converters as shown in Figure 2-3. A descrip tion of this
implementation is given in Chapter 8. Another feature of brcshlcss DC motors
is their effectiveness in heat dissipation. This is because the windings arc
mounted on the stator which is in contact with the motor housing through a
large area.
2.3.2 Commercialized Motors
Photo 2-2 shows commercialized brushless D.C. torque motors developed
by International Scientific Inc.; the same type of motors as the ones used for
MIT Direct-Drive Arms. The permanent magnets cemented on the rotor rings
arc high performance Samarium-Cobalt magnets , whose maximun magnetic
energy product is over 26 MGOe. This rare earth magnet stores 3 to 10 times
larger magnetic energy than conventional magnets, such as ferrite and AlNiCo
magnets.
Table 2-1 shows specifications of one of the largest brushless motors taken
from the manufacturer's catalogue. The maximum torque of the motor is 660
Nm, which is an order of magnitude larger than for a conventional D.C. torquer
of the same size. The elim ination of the brush allows us to supply large currents
to the windings, and the strong magnets produce a high flux density. Since the
magnctic flux is attenuated somehow by the currents flowing in the stator
windings, the maximum torque listed in the catalogue data should be decreased.
Nevertheless, this type of motor exerts the largest torque among the three types
of the direct-drive motors.
A variety of techniques have been devised for reducing torque ripple. In
the same way as conventional D.C. torquers, the number of poles is increased in
the rotor design. As shown in Table 2-1. the 356 mm (14 inch) brushless motor
has 30 poles. Increasing the number of slots on the stator is also effective to
smoothen the torque.
Another technique to reduce the torque ripple is to arrange the rotor and
stalor pole positions to be "allo-periodic". If all the poles at the rotor and the
stator arc aligned at the same rotor position (iso-periodic), the resultant torque
ripple becomes prominanL To avoid this, the number of the rotor poles is made
slightly different from that of the rotor. The brushless D.C. torque motors in
Photo 2-2 cmploy this technique to reduce the torque ripple.

2.4 Variable Reluctance Motors
2.4.1 Principle
Another type of high-torque, low-specd motors used for direct- drive robots
are variable reluctance motors. The principle of the variable reluctance motor
is similar to that of a stepping motor, as shown in Figure 2-4. The stator has
windings which create the flux passing through the stator and the tooth of the
rotor, which is made of a magnetic substance. The rotor is at a stable position
when the teeth of the rotor and the stator are aligned, as shown in Figure 2-4(a).
A restoring force is generated as the rolor position varies from the stable
position; Figure 2-4 (b). Figure 2-4(c) shows the relationship betwecn the
restoring force/and the displacement e.
Figure 2-5 shows an extended structure of the motor in Figure 2-4. The stator has three phase windings; <h, <Ilz, and <P3' Note that the pitch of the rotor teeth is different from that of the stator. When the coil of phase <PI is excited.
the rotor is stable at the position shown in the Figure. As the coil of phase 4>2 is
excited consecutively, the rotor moves towards the tooth positions shown by the broken lines. As for the phase $3 coil. the stable position of the rotor is moved
continuously by exciting the three-phase windings sequentially. Figure 2-5(b)
shows the torque excited by the three-phase stepping motor.
The motor of this type is referred to as a Variable Reluctance Stepping
Motor. The motor has some desirable advantages over thc other types of

motors. However, to apply the variable reluctance motors to dircct-drive robots.
the following problems must be overcome:
1. When an excessively high speed or high acceleration motion is commanded, the rotor motion can be out of phase with the excitation timing of the stator windings.
2. The fluctuation in torque is prominent
3. Since the rotor position is stable only when the teeth of the rotor are aligned with the ones of the stator. the possible positioning points are limited; namely coarse positioning resolution.
4. The ratio of motor weight to output torque tends to be higher than other motors.
To solve the first three problems, a closed loop current control using a
rotor position sensor has been employed. With the rotor position information,
the excitation of each phase windings can be accomplished correctively, thus no
out-of-phase motion occurs.
As in the case of the brushless D.C. torquer. sinusoidal excitation currents can be prodoced with the rotor position information. In principle the rotor can
be positioned at an arbitrary position by this closed-loop current control along
with the sinusoidal phase excitation. The torque ripple can be also reduced on
the same principle as the brushless motor .
2.4.2 Commercialized Motors
Efficient methods [0 increase the output torque arc to reduce the air gap
distance and to increase the number of teeth. Photo 2-3 shows the variable
reluctance direct-drive motor developed by Motometics Co.• which employed
the construction of increased teeth number. The number of teeth is 150 for the
rotor and 144 for the stator. The motor consists of a rotor and the two stators;
the inner and the outer stators as shown in Figure 2-6. This special construction
was devised so that the drive torque is generated at both sides of the rotor. In
fact, the number of teeth has increased to twice that of the single stator.
Each stator has 18 poles. and 6 segments of coils arc connected in series.
As shown in the figure, the windings arc arranged so that the flux passes
through the rotor in the radial direction. This construction allows the motor to
reduce the internal loss of magnetic energy, and as a result a large motor
constant C3n be obtained.
Table 2-2 shows major specifications of the 356 mm (14 inch) variable
reluctance 0.0. motor developed by Motometics. Note that the motor constant

is larger than that of the brushless motor in Table 2-1. The maximum torque,
however, is less than one half of that developed by the same size brushlcss motor. The continuous torque, on the other hand, is larger for the variable
reluctance motor since the power dissipated in the variable reluctance motor is
smaller than the brush1ess motor.
Variable reluctance mOlars, in general, have more prominantlorque ripple
and nonlinear torque-speed characteristics. Compensations for these
nonlinearities are critical issues for their application to the direct-drive robots.

2.S Issues in Arm Design and Control
Fundamental characteristics of the components involved in a direct-drive system were analyzed in the previous sections. We now discuss critical issues
in the design and control of the direct-drive systems. The direct -drive system
has several problems that make the application to the robot drive difficult. To
exploit the potential features described in Chapter I, we need to overcome the
problems critical to the successful application to the robot drive.
2.5.1 Small Payload vs. Heavy Arm Weight
As noted in Section 1.3. the first implementation of the direct-drive robot at Carnegie-Mcllon University resulted in a heavy arm weight and a small payload capacity. Having individual molars at the joints of the serial arm


Chapter2 39
linkage, the robot becomes considerably heavy. The weight of the motor that
drives a wrist joint is a load for the motor at the elbow. Both motors arc then
loads for the motor at a shoulder joint. Thus, the torque required for succeeding joints increases exponentially down the serial arm linkage. Accordingly, the
size and weight of the succeeding motors increase exponentially [Asada and
Kanade, 1983].
Alternative arm designs to suppress the exponential weight increase arc
necessary from a practical standpoint. As adopted in the M.LT. Direct-Drive Arms and the commercialized arms, it is particularly efficient to use appropriate mechanisms for driving ann joints remotely with the motors located ncar the
arm base. A critical issue of the remote drive is then to overcome some deficits resulting from the usc of extra mechanical transmissions.
2.5.2 Damping Characteristics
The direct-drive system has almost zero damping • which may cause
difficult problems in the control system design. Mechanical damping is
produced only at the bearings supporting the joint shafts. The mechanical time constant, which is determined by the ratio of the inertial load to the mechanical
d.unping coefficient. is then excessively large, compared with gear-drive
systems. The back emf at the drive motor yields a damping effect. because the voltage applied to the motor is substantially reduced by the back emf, which is in proportion with the molar speed. This electromechanical damping effect is
far less than the amount of damping necessary to stabilize the system response. In consequence. we need to increase the damping in the control system des ign. Velocity feedback compensation is a straightforward approach to the
improvement of the damping characteristics. As shown in Equ. (2.11), the damping coefficient increases by an amount kJ</R with velocity feedback. The control system design for the C.M.V. and M.I.T. arms revealed that onc must
choose the velocity feedback gain kv to be a considerably large valuc in order to attain satisfactory rcsponses. Accurate velocity measurement with a low noise
level is then neeessary to enable such a high gain velocity feedback. However, the velocity measurement for the direct-drive robot is marc difficult than gear drive robots. This is because the speed of a direct-drive motor is as slow as the link motion. while the motor speed of the gear-drive robot is much faster than the arm link. hence easier to measure the velocity. As a rcsult. we need a high performance sensor appropriate for the measurmcm of the low speed motion.


40 Direct-Drive Robots
2.5.3 Servo Stiffness
A robot manipulator arm is subject to a variety of disturbance forces
particularly at its endpoint or the end effector. In positioning control. the robot
is required to maintain the commanded position in the face of the extemalload.
The ability to reflect a static disturbance fo rce is often evaluated in terms of the
endpoint stiffness [Asada and Siotine 861. that is. the ratio of the static force
applied at the arm's endpoint to the resultant static deflection at the same point
The higher the endpoint stiffness becomes. the better the robot can bear the
l oad and maintain the positi oning accuracy.
The endpoint stiffness is determined by the feedback loop gains of
individual joint servomechanism s as well as the mechanical construction of the
manipulator arm. For a gear-drive robot. the loop gain increases with the gear
ratio, ni' since the motor o utput torque is amplified by the gear reducer. The
direct-drive robot, however, cannot take this advantage of the reducer; there is
no means to amplify the actuator torque mechanically. In consequenc e, the
direct -drive robot needs a higher controller gain to compensate for the deficit
of the loop gain. Again, the critical issue is the stability of the drive system.
2.5.4 Motor Inductance Effects
Direct-drive motors for robotics applications arc generally designcd for
maximum output torques. To eliminate a mechanical gearing. the large output
torque is the most importan t specification in the motor design. However, this
requirement leads to the use of large windings, which have significantly large
inductances. As described in Equ. (2.13), the electric time constant, which is
determined by the motor inductance, becomes particularly slow for a large
direct-drive motor having as large inductance. The slow time constant may
cause a stability problem.
For traditional servomotors used in the gear-drive robot, the mOlor
inductance is negligibly small. Hence, the effect of the electric time constant is
negligible, and the drive system can be treated as a sec ond- order system, unless
other higher-order delays are prominant. Thus, the drive system is inherently
stable with an appropriate damping. By contrast, often the direct-drive system
can be unstable due to the motor inductance effect. To cope with this problem,
the amplifier of the direct-drive motor must have fast dynam ic responses to
drive motor currents quickly in spite of the large inductance. Also. the control
system must be designed carefully so that the stability margin can be
sufficiently large.


Chapter2 41
2.S.S Arm Dynamics Effects
In general. the dynamic behavior of a manipulator arm is highly coupled and nonlinear [Asada and Slotine 86]. The arm inertia varies depending upon the arm configuration. The acceleration of one joint affects other joints due to the reaction of the accelerated joint. This reaction causes coupling among the
multiple joints. The configuration dependency of the manipulator inertia matrix
induces the Coriolis and centrifugal torques, which are nonlinear torques
comprising products of joint velocities.
When the manipulator arm is actuated with gearing, the complex arm dynamics are attenuated by the gearing when reflected to the motor shafts. Let
nj be the gear reduction ratio of the ith drive mechanism, then the dynam ic
equation of the ilh motor is given by
( 1ann) •• 'tcoup 'tnoll
1 1+ -- a·+ --+ --='t_A•
ro 2 j n. n. """
n, j I
(2.17)
where 'tmol is the torque exerted by the motor, and 'tcoup and'tlloll are,
respectively. the coupling and nonlinear torques, which arc attenuated by the factor of nj when reflected to the motor axis. The first term of the above equation accounts for the inertial torque associated with the acceleration of the actuator, <Xj• The moment of inertia is comprised of the inertia of the motor rotor 1rOl, including the reducer inertia, and the inertia of the arm links farm' which is reduced by the square of the gear ratio nj whcn reflected to the motor axis. It should be noted that the arm link inertia varies depending upon the arm
configuration, whilst the rotor inertia is invariant. The effect of the varying inertia is negligibly small upon the motor dynamics, if the gear ratio nj is
sufnciently large. The system parameters can be modeled as constants for the
manipulator arm.
The direct-drive arm, where the gear ratio is equal to 1. is signincantly different from the gear-drive robot. The complex :arm dynamics arc directly
reflected to the motor axes due to the direct coupling. The varying inertia effect
as well as the effects of the coupling and nonlinear torques arc more prominant
for the direct-drive robot. This creates difficult problems in the design of the
control system. One should accomplish stable responses and sufnciently high
gains despite the highly nonlinear and coupled dynamics. Considering the other
substantial difficulties discussed above. we need to develop an efficient method to decouple the arm dynamics complexity from the control probl ems of the


42 Direct-Dr;"e Robots
individual actuators.
2.5.6 Overheat
When a manipulator arm is at rest, the weight of the arm li nks is a load to
each joint. For the gear-drive robot, the gravity load is allenuated by the gear
reducer by a factor of nj as shown in Equ. (2. 1 7). Moreover, the gearing
mechanism introduces friction , which acts in the opposite direction of the joint
motion. As a result, the gravity load can be borne in part by the friction at the
gearing.
As the gearing is eliminated in the direct-drive robot, the gravity load must
be borne by the motor entirely and directly. This requi res the motor to exert a
larger amount of continuous torque for a long time. Thus, another critical issue
in the direct-drive robot is the overheating problem under the continuous load
condition. Efficient arm design techniques and motor technologies must be
developed in order to avoid the overheat of the motors.

ARM DESIGN THEORY


Chapter 3
Statics
3.1 Introduction
In this chapter, we focus on the static charactcristics of manipulators.
Specifically, we consider a manipulator, such as the one shown in Figure 3-1,
where n actuators are used to drive the ann linkage. Each actuator produces a
torque 't which is combined with other motor ' torques through the link
mechanism to generate a force F at the endpoint to do work. The ability to
produce a useful force F without overheating the actuators is of great
importance in the design of direct-drive arms, since all gearing has been
eliminated. In order to study these characteristics, the system consisting of the
drive mechanisms and the ann linkage must be considered. In what follows, an
analytical tool is presented for evaluating mechanisms in terms of the power
dissipation in the actuators and the end point force generated. This is
particularly important in evaluating the overheating of direct-drive actuators
under static load conditions. Two different mechanisms are selected and
compared for use in the direct-drive approach.
3.2 Power Efficiency Analysis
One of the problems with the direct drive approach is that the robot cannot
exert a large force. Because of the direct coupling of motors to their loads, the
output torques of motors are not amplified through reducers. In consequcnce,
the motors have to bear the loads directly, and can ovcrheat, particularly in a
stall condition. In this section, we analyze the power dissipated in the motors
when a force is exerted at the tip of the arm.
An important parameter of torque motors is the motor constant as
described in Chapter 2 and given by Equ. (2.8). It is the ratio of the output
torque 't to the square root of power dissipated P in the motor [Electro-Craft
80],

The motor constant represents the efficiency with which the motor convcrts its
input power into output torque. If km is small, the motor dissipates a large
amount of power to exert a smalltorquc.
When a robot bears a load at the arm tip, the load is distributed among all
the motors of the arm mechanism. Hence, in addition to the individual motor
characteristics, the efficiency of exerting a force at the arm tip also depends on
the kinematic structure of the ann mechanism. Let F be the end point force
exerted at the arm tip represented in cartesian coordinates, and let 1: be the
vector of equivalent torques of n motors. then one obtains [paul 81]
(3.2)
where J is the jacobian matrix associated with the coordinate transformation
from the joint coordinates to the cartesian coordinates of the arm tip. A brief
note on the jacobian matrix is given in Appendix D.
Let P be the total power dissipated in the n motors driving the arm
mechanism and kmi be the motor constant of the i-th motor, then the total power
dissipation, P, is given by the following quadratic fonn of end point force F.

where L is given by
L=Jdiag(�• . . . •�)JT kml kmn
(3.3)
(3.4)
Thus the power dissipation depends not only on the kinematic structure, but
also on the motor constants of the actuators.
The relation given by Equ. (3.4) is a congruence transformation, and thus
the matrix L is positive definite as long as the Jacobian matrix is nonsingular
[Strang 80]. Therefore. the matrix L has all real, positive eigenvalues, A,>O,
and the quadratic form can be rewritten as
II

�
,I
i=l (3.5)


48 Direct-Dri.'e Robots
where Fj is the component of end point force along the eigenvector
corresponding to Aj• The geometrical interpretation of Equ.(3.3) is obtained by
fixing the total power P. In this case , the quadratic form of Equ. (3.3) is that of
an ellipsoid as shown in Figure 3-2. The principal axes of such an ellipsoid are
aligned with the eigenvectors of the matrix L, and the length of each principal
axis is equal to the reciprocal of the square root of the corresponding
eigenvalue. The static characteristics will depend on arm configuration since the
smallest (largest) eigenvalue of L corresponds to the major (minor) axis of the
ellipsoid, the maximum (minimum) force F acts along the major (minor) axis.
Therefore, along the major axis, the input power is most effectively converted
into a force at the arm tip. Since the matrix L involves the Jacobian matrix J,
which varies with the arm configuration. By examining the ellipsoid for
different arm configurations, one can analyze the global characteristics of the
power to force conversion.
To evaluate the overall efficiency of the arm-motor combination. we
define the mean power dissipation ratio, Am' which is the mean of the
eigenvalues and is given by
1
Am = - trace(L)
n
The units of Am are Watts per square Newton.
3.3 Kinematic Structure Design
3.3.1 Parallel Drive Mechanism
(3.6)
In order to select a suitable kinematic structure for a direct-drive arm, we
consider the following basic structures: a simple serial drive mechanism. as
shown in Figure 3-3; and a general five-bar-link parallel drive mechanism,
shown in Figure 3-4.
In this section we define these two drive system methods: serial drive and
parallel drive. Figure 3-3 shows the typical construction of a serial drive arm
mechanism, in which the lower link is driven by a motor fixed on the base and
the upper link is driven by a motor attached at the tip of the lower link. In this
serial configuration, the weight of the second motor is a load to the first motor.
Moreover, the reaction torque of the second motor acts on the first motor.

When the second motor accelerates in the clockwise direction, a counter clockwise torque acts on the first motor, and vise versa. Thus the two motors
have significant interactions. In this book, an arm mechanism in which each motor is located at a joint of a serial linkage between the adjacent links is referred to as a serial drive mechanism. Figure 3-4 shows an alternative arm construction consisting of a five-bar link mechanism. Two motors fixed on the base drive the two inpu t links and cause a two-dimensional motion at the lip of the arm. The weight of one motor is not a load on the other. Also the reaction torque of one motor does not act directly upon the other, because the motors are fixed on the base . An arm
mechanism in which motors are mounted on a fixture and the weight and
reaction torque of one motor do not affect the other motors directly is referred
to as a parallel drive mechanism. The parallel drive mechanism has been used in several models of commercial robots that have conventional
electromechanical drives with gearings. The five-bar-link mechanism, however, is particularly useful for overcoming the inherent difficulties of the direct drive method.
3.3.2 Motor Constant Identification
In order to use the analysis of the previous section, the motor constants,
kmi' have to be determined. The following experiment was conducted to
identify the motor constant of a single active joint. First, a position control system is set up to permit the arbitrary positioning of the motor rotor using a
computer terminal (see Chapter 8). This position control system is needed
because the relationships derived in the previous section arc valid at stall condition. Second, known torque loads were applied to the motor shaft while under position control and the power dissipated by the system was calculated using the phase currents in the motor. These phase currents arc in error due to
sensor limitations and must be corrected. A procedure in correcting these
current readings is given in Appendix A. Figure 3·5 provides a plot of the
experimental data. The square root of power measured is plottcd against the
torque applied. A least square fit yields a motor constant of 2.366 NmNWalts.
3.3.3 Kinematic Structure Evaluation
The end point force for the serial drive mechanism in comparison with the parallcl drive mechanism of Figure 3-6 is evaluated. These characteristics were analyzed in CAsada and Youcef-Toumi 83a, Asada and Youccf-Toumi 84J.

For the five-bar-Iink parallel drive mechanism, the matrix L is given by
where
where the end point force F is represented in the coordinate system fixed at the base as shown in Figure 3-6. Figure 3-7 illustrates the static force characteristics, Equ. (3.3), for the parallel configuration. The maximum (minimum) force produced is along the major (minor) axis of the ellipsoid at the tip of the arm. Note that in this parallel configuration the force appears to be nearly isotropic in a wid� region . The maximum force based on a total power of lKW is estimated to be 190N. This value is obtained by taking the square root of the ratio of the power La the minimum eigenValue. The mean power dissipation ratio is then given by
(3.7)
Although the matrix L varies with the arm configuration, the mean power
dissipation Am is uniform for all the configurations. For shorter link lengths, 11
and 14, and larger motor constants, kml and km2• the arm-motor combination has a beller efficiency having a small mean power dissipation ratio.

In this case, Am varies depending on the arm configuration. As 02 increases. Am
becomes larger. namely. the efficiency becomes lowCf. Comparing Equ. (3.7) with Equ. (3.8), one finds the parallel drive has a smaller mean power dissipation ratio than the serial drive except when
1°21 � cos-1 (;;)
The mean power curves are shown in Figure 3-8.
(3.9)
In the case of the M.I.T. direct-drive robot Model II described in Figure
3-6, link lengths, II and 14, are 0.40m and O.65m respectively, and the angle of joint 2 is limited by 350 $ 92 � 1700 The parallel drive mechanism has a better efficiency for all arm configurations within the limit. This is another important
advantage of the parallel drive mechanism over the serial drive. Having the
same motor constants and the same link lengths throughout the same
workspace, the parallel drive mechanism can more efficiently exert force at the
arm tip.
Let us now consider the same mechanism, where the links arc crossed, thus yielding completely different kinematic characteristics. This cross drive configuration (mode II) depicted in Figure 3-9, shows a complete change in the
static force characteristics. The force ellipsoid reduces to a line in the reachable
region. The ratio between the maximum and minimum force at any point in space is greater than 11. This value is on Ihe order of 1.6 for the parallel drive
of MODE I. The MODE II configuration of this mechanism can thus be used in
applications where a large force is desired along the directions shown in Figure
3-9. This force. while having a preferred direction, is much larger than what the mechanism in MODE I configuration can produce. The m<uimum payload
based on a total power of 1 KW is 33 Kg. The M.I.T. direct-drive robot models
II and IV have the ability to change modes [Asada and Youccf-Toumi 83a}.

3.4 Conclusion
This chapter has presented an analytical tool for evaluating actuated
mechanisms in terms of power dissipation and endpoint force static
characteristics. These tools arc shown to be useful in selccting an appropriate
arm linkage design for a specific application. As an example, by analyzing the
internal power dissipation in the motors when the manipulator exerts a force at
the endpoint, it was shown that the parallel drive mechanism has a lower power
dissipation than a serial drive that uses the same motors and covers the same
w()rkspace.

Arm Design for Simplified Dynamics
4.1 Introduction
A manipulator design theory for reduced dynamic complexity is presented.
The kinematic structure and mass distribution of a manipulator arm are
designed so that the inertia matrix in the equation of motion become� diagonal
and/or invariant for an arbitrary arm configuration. For the decoupled and
invariant inertia matrix. the system can be treated as a linear, single-input.
single-output system with constant parameters. Consequently. control of the
manipulator arm is simplified. and more importantly, the reduced dynamic
complexity permits improved control performance.
First, the problem of designing such an arm with a decouplcd and/or
configuration-invariant inertia matrix is defined. The inertia matri" is then
analyzed in relation 10 thc kinematic structure and mass properties of the arm
links. Necessary conditions for a decouplcd and/or configuration-invariant
manipulator inertia matrix are then obtained. Using the necessary conditions,
the kinematic structure and mass properties arc found which reduce the inertia
matrix to a constant diagonal form. Possible arm designs for decoupled and/or
invariant inertia malIiccs are then determi ned for 2 and 3 degree-oC-freedom
manipulators.
Dynamic complexity, such as coupling and nonlincaritics arc major
concerns in the control of manipulator arms. This problem is critical in
manipulators designed for high speed applications which have p3rticularly
prominant dynamiC complexity. Also, in direct-drive arms and other
manipulator arms in which the gear ratios of reducers are low, the complicated
dynamic has a morc dircct influence upon the drive mechanisms [Asada and
Youcef-Toumi 84}. Again the control problcm becomes more complex and
difficult because of the prominant coupling and nonlincarities.
A number of conlIol methods have been developed for manipulators.
Applications of model-referenced adaptive control [Dubowsky and Des Forges
79], [Takegaki and Arimoto 811. nonlinear feedback control [Freund 82], and


64 Direct-Dri.'e Robots
sliding mode control [Utkin 72, Utkin 77, Ulkin 78, Young 78, Slotine and
Sastry 83] have made significant contributions to the improvement of control
performance. Dynamic computation algorithms [Luh, Walker, and Paul 80], [Hollerbach 80], parameter estimation methods [Atkeson, An, and Hollerbach 85]. [Mayeda, Osuka, and Kangawa 84], and customized inverse dynamics
methods [Kanade, Khosla and Tanaka 84] have allowed us to compensate for
the complicated arm dynamics in realtime and in an intelligent manner.
Another method for reducing dynamic complexity and improving
dynamic performance involves the coordination of the controller and manipulator design efforts. In this method, the mechanical construction of a
manipulator arm is modified so that the resultant dynamic behavior can be
improved or becomes desirable for control [Asaela 83]. In general, the
dynamics of a manipulator arm depends upon the mass properties of individual
arm links and the kinematic structure of the arm linkage. Redistribution of mass
and modification of the arm structure can provide improvements in the manipulator dynamics.
The goal of this chapter is to explore arm linkage design for reducing
dynamic complexity, and consequently reducing the control difficullies. First,
some particular forms of the dynamic equations arc presented in which the inertia matrix is reduced to a diagonal and/or configuration invariant form. Then, a design theory is developed for achciving the desired manipulator
dynamics. Finally, possible arm structures and mass distributions for reducing
the dynamic complexity are determined.
4.2 Decoupling and Configuration-Invariance of ManipUlator Dynamics
Desirable forms for the manipulator dynamics arc formulated in this
section. The significance of each of these forms is discussed with reference to
how the control problem can be simplified, and how much the computational complication is relaxed.
Let 9j and 'tj be the joint displacement and torque of the i'h joint,
respectively, then the equation of motion of the manipulator arm is given by
[Asada and Youcef-Toumi 84] [Asada and S lotinc 86]

where l/ij is the i-j element of the manipulator inertia matrix, and 'tg; is the torque due to gravity. The first term on the right hand side represents the inertia torque generated by the acceleration of the ilh joint, while the second term is the interactive inertia torque caused by the accelerations of the other joints. The interactive inertia torque is linearly proportional to acceleration. The third term represents the nonlinear velocity torques resulting from Coriolis and centrifugal effects. In general, the dependence of the incrtia matrix on the arm configuration produces these nonlinear velocity torques.
The inertia matrix is determined by the kinematic structure of the manipulator arm and the mass properties of individual links. The design problem discussed in this paper requires modification of both the kinematic structure and the mass properties of the arm linkage so that the inertia matrix reduces to the particular desired forms. Consider the inertia matrix that reduces to a diagonal matrix for an arbitrary arm configuration, then the second term in Equ. (4.1) vanishes and no interactive torques appear. The manipulator inertia matrix in this case is referred to as a decoupled inertia matrix. The significance of the decoupled inertia matrix is that the control system can be treated as a set of single-input, single-output subsystems associated with individual joint motions. The
equation of motion under these conditions reduces to

where the second term represents the nonlinear velocity torques resulLing from the spatial dependency of the diagonal clements of the inertia matrix. Note that the number of terms inv olved in Equ. (4.2) is much smaller than the number of original nonlinear velocity torques, because all the off-diagonal elements are zcro for all e1, • • • ,en' This reduces the computational complexity of the nonlinear torques.
Another significant form of the inertia matrix that reduces the dynamic complexity is a configuration-invariant form. The inertia matrix in this case


66 Direcl-Dri.'e Robots
does not vary for an arbitrary arm configuration. In other words, the matrix is
independent of joint displacements, hence the third term in Equ. (4.1) vanishes
and the equation of motion reduces to
'tj==:/I;/Jj+ �Hij:aj+'r.gj
j�j (4.3)
Note that the coefficients IIj; and Ilij are constant for all ann configurations. Thus, the equation is linear except the last term, thal is, the gravity torque. The
inertia matrix in this form is referred to as an invariant inertia matrix. The
significance of this fonn is that linear control schemes can be adopted, which
are much simpler and easier to implement.
When the inertia matrix is both decoupled and configuration invariant, the
equation of reduces to
(4.4)
The system is completely dccoupled and linearized. except the gravity term.
Thus, we can treat the system as single-input, single-output systems with
constant parameters.
The decouplcd and configuration-invariant inertia matrix was first
accomplished in reference [Asada and Youcef-Toumi 84], in which a special
five-bat-link parallcl drive mechanism was devised for a dircct-drive arm . The
feasibility and practical usefulness were also demonstrated through the
development of the special arm. However, extension to general manipulator
arms was not made in a comprchcnsive form. In this chapter, the conditions for
the kinematic structure and mass properties of the manipulator ann which
provide a decouplcd and/or configuration-invariant inertia are determined.
4.3 Modelling
In this section, we derive the inertia tensor matrices of the manipulator arms discussed in this paper. As shown in Figure 4-1, the manipulator arm is
assumed to be an open kinematic chain consisting of only revolute joints, The

joints are numbered 1 through n from the proximal joint to the distal joint The link between joints i and i+1 is called link i. The direction of the axis of joint i
is represented by a unit vector bi and the displacement of link i is denoted by 9j which is the angle of rotation about the unit vector. The centroid of link k is
shown by point CJc in the figure, the velocity vector of the centroid is denoted by
VJc and the angular velocity vector by rok• Let mk and IJc be the mass and the inertia tensor of link k with respect to the O-xyz inertial reference frame. then the total kinetic energy stored in the arm links from 1 to n is given by

Note that the inertia matrix is symmetric, hence lIij=lIji• We also derive a
different expression for the inertia matrix, which we need in the following
analysis. Let I be an arbitrary joint number. We consider the case in which all
the joints between i+l and n are immobilized. The last (n-I+l) links are then
treated as a single rigid body. As shown in Figure 4-2, let MI,1I and PI be,
respectively, the total mass of the last (n-I+ 1) links and the position vector from point 01 to the centroid C/,1I that is the centroid of the last (n-I+ 1) links. Then,

4.4 Analysis
In order to eliminate the coupling and nonlinear torques, the inertia matrix
must be diagonalized and made invariant fo r all the arm configurations. In this
section, we analyze the inertia matrix and derive the necessary conditions for
the kinematic structure and mass properties to allow the reduction of the inertia
matrix to a diagonal and/or invariant form.
4.4.1 Off-diagonal elements
We first discuss the necessary conditions for an off-diagonal clement,
Ilij = Ilji (i<,;). to be zero or invariant for all the arm configurations. We derive
the necessary conditions by considering a special situation where only one joint.
say joint I, rotates 360 degrees, while the other joints are immobilized. This
simple analysis provides useful conditions that arc used to determine the
kinematic structure and mass properties for decoupled and/or configuration
invarian t inertia.
As shown in Figure 4-3, we immobilize all the joints beyond joint I, and
regard the last (n-I+ 1) links as a single rigid body. Let OCI,n be the
perpendicular from the centroid CI,n to the joint axis b/. We locate the inertial
reference frame O-xyz at the point 0, which is chosen to coincide with point 0,
on joint axis b,. Without loss of generality, we can orient the z axis in the same
direction as that of joint axis bl• The displacement of joint I is thcn represented
by the angle from the x axis to the vector PI' which is the position vector of the
centroid CI•II relative to the origin O. Denoting the length of the vector PI by
LIII, we obtain,

The inertia tensor N1,n' that is the composite inertia tensor of the last (n-l+l)
links, varies in its matrix expression, as the joint angle 01 changes. Let N/•1I be
the composite inertia tensor when 0, = 0, the matrix N,,n is given by
where A is the 3><3 rotation matrix given by
-sin 9, 0 ]
cos 0, 0 o1
(4.17)
(4.18)
For simplicity, the subscripts I and n are neglected unless the notation gets confusing. The elements of the inertia tensor N arc then written as
Nxx Nxy Nxz
N= Nxy NY] Nyz (4.19)
Nn Nyz Nzz
When the joint axis bi is not orthogonal to the joint axis b/, the i'h joint axis
intersects with the x-y plane. If we define the intersection as the representative point on the i1h joint axis, the position vector rjJ• that is the vector from points
oi to 0/. can be written as

The direction cosines of the ith joint axis are denoted by
(4.21)
Substituting Equ. (4. 16)-Equ. (4.21» into Equ. (4.14) yields the expression

Note that the subscripts I and n for M and L arc neglected. The following proposition is derived directly from Equ. (4.22)
Proposition (4.1): The necessary condition for the off-diagonal
clement of the inertia matrix, IIii' to be invariant for an arbitrary 9l are given by
(4.23)
and
(4.24)
In addition to the above conditions, the first term in Equ. (4.22) must be zero when the decoupled inertia matrix is required. However, the off-diagonal


Chapter 4 75
element 1Iil does not vanish unless bz = O. since the diagonal clement of the
inertia tensor Nzz is always positive. When bz = O. the two joint axes arc perpendicular to each other. and we conclude the following.
Proposition (4.2): For manipulator arms with an open kinematic chain structure, the inertia matrix cannot be dccoupled unless the joint axes are orthogonal to each other.
When bf bl = 0, namely the two joint axes are orthogonal, we can direct the x
axis of the inertial reference frame along the joint axis bi, without loss of generality As shown in Figure 4-4.
(4.25)
Let OJ be the representative point of joint i that is located at the intersection of
the joint axis and the y-z plane as shown in the figure, then the position vector
rj,l can be expressed as
(4.26)
Using the above equations in Equ. (4.14), we obtain
(4.27)
The following is derived directly from the above results

Proposition (4.3): When joint axes bj and bl are orthogonal, the necessary conditions for the off-diagonal element lIiI to vanish for an
arbitrary joint angle 91 are given by

(4.28)
and

4.4.2 Diagonal elements
Next, we consider diagonal elements of the inertia matrix, /lji' Letl be an arbitrary joint number greater than or equal to i. We investigate the change in
/Iii when the joint angle 91 varies from 0 to 360 degrccs. As in the case of
Figure 4-3, we immobilize all the joints beyond I and treat the last (n-/+ 1) links as a single rigid body. Again we use the inertial reference from the centroid CI,n to the joint axis b/. From Equ. (4.14),
(4.30)
where liii is a constant parameter independent of S/' and is given by
(4.31)
We first derive the conditions that the diagonal clement /Iii is invariant for
an arbitrary 9/, when the joint axes, b, and bj, are not orthogonal. Then we
discuss the case where the axes are orthogonal to each other. Substituting Equ. (4.20) and Equ. (4.21) into Equ. (4.30) yields
where the coefficients ao' ..., as are given by

Eliminating 'x in the above two equations, we obtain (b; + b;)ry = 0, which
is satisfied if, and only if, one of the following two conditions is met:
i) bx = by = 0, namely, joint axes hi and bl are parallcl, or
ii) rx = ry = 0, namely, the joint axes intersect at the origin O.
In the same way, we can derive a similar expression, (b; + b;)2iJX)' = O. from Equ. (4.39) and Equ. (4.40). This leads to the following two conditions:
i) bx = by = 0, or
- - 2
ii)N.ty=OandNxx+ML =Nyy
Similarly, necessary conditions can be derived for two joints which arc orthogonal to each other. Summarizing the above results, the following
proposition is obtained.

4.5 Design
4.5.1 Arm Design for DecoupJed Inertia
Based on the previous analysis on the necessary conditions. we determine
the kinematic structure and mass properties of a manipulator arm that possesses dccouplcd and/or invariant inertia matrices.
First. we consider the decoupled inertia. From Proposition (4.2) it follows
that all the joint axes must be orthogonal for an arbitrary arm configuration to accomplish the dccouplcd incnia. The kinematic stnlcturc in which all the joint axes arc orthogonal at all time is limited to two degree-or-freedom arms only.


Chapter 4 81
For the inertia matrix of the 2 d.o.f. arm, the off-diagonal clement to be considered is only 1112, and the joint desplaccmcnt that might cause changes in
1112 is 92, Then we can derive the necessary conditions for invariant inertia by
applying Proposition (4.3) only to II�� .
Conversely, if the necessary conditions on IIF:] arc substituted into Equ.
(4.22) to compute the off-diagonal clement 1112, one can find that the off diagonal element vanishes for an arbitrary 92, Consequently, the necessary conditions also provide the sufficient conditions for decoupled inertia. Therefore the following obtained:
Theorem (4.1): An open.kincmatie-chain manipulator arm possesses a dccoupled inertia matrix for an arbitrary arm configuration if, and only if, its kinematic structure and mass properties satisfy the following conditions:
Structure: two degree-of-freedom arm with orthogonal joint axes (Figure 4-5).
and
where the notations are defined in Figure 4-5.
(4.45)
(4.46)
Special cases, which are practically useful, are shown in Figure 4-6. In the first arm design, the centroid of link 2 lies on the joint axis h2' namely, L = 0,
and in the second arm design the perpendicular from the centroid of link 2 to the jOint axis b2 intersects with the common normal of the two joint axes, namely, 'z = O. For each of the two cases, the left hand side of Equ. (4.45) is
zero, hence Nxz must be coincident with the joint axis h2_ since Nyz is also zero from condition Equ. (4.46).
4.5.2 Arm Design for DecoupJed and Invariant Inertia
Manipulator arms with dccouplcd and configuration-invariant inertia matrices arc discussed in this subsection. To be decoupled, the conditions given in Theorem (4.1) must hold. At the same time, the diagonal clement 1111 must
