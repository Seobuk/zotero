Design and Characterization of a Novel Hybrid Actuator Using Shape Memory Alloy and DC Micromotor for Minimally Invasive Surgery Applications
Venkata Raghavaiah Chowdhary Kode and M. Cenk C¸ avus¸ogˇlu, Senior Member, IEEE

Abstract—The end-effectors in the state-of-the-art robotic tools for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) are actuated by actuator packs located outside the patient’s body, with the power transmitted from the actuator pack to the end-effector by means of sliding link or tendon-driven mechanisms. This method of power transmission limits the number of degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) in these systems, as the design of a spherical wrist gets complicated. The design of the spherical wrists can be simpliﬁed, and the number of DOFs increased, if local actuation is used for the end-effector. However, there are no suitable actuation systems available in the literature. In this paper, a novel design idea for developing a millimeter-scale actuator is presented for locally actuating the end-effector (5-mm-diameter laparoscopic needle driver) for a robot performing MIS. This actuator is designed by combining a dc micromotor and a shape memory alloy actuator in series. The designed actuator is 5.14 mm in diameter (including casing) and 40 mm in length, and is used to actuate a 20-mm-long needle driver assembly, while generating a force of 24 N, resulting in a gripping force of 8 N. The total stroke length of the actuator is 1 mm, which results in a 45◦ opening of the needle driver jaw with a gap of 8 mm in between the jaws.

Laparoscopic surgery is a revolutionary surgical technique [1] that is minimally invasive. In laparoscopic surgery, the operation is performed with instruments inserted through small incisions (less than 10 mm in diameter) rather than by making a large incision to expose the operation site. The main advantage of this technique is the reduced trauma to the healthy tissue, which is the leading cause of postoperative pain and long hospital stay of the patient. The hospital stay and rest periods, and the resulting procedure’s cost, are signiﬁcantly reduced with MIS, at the expense of more difﬁcult techniques currently performed by surgeons. Adoption of laparoscopic techniques has been slower in more complex procedures, largely because of the greater difﬁculty due to the surgeon’s reduced dexterity and perception of the operation.
There are two commercially available telemanipulation systems that are currently in use for minimally invasive cardiac surgery: the da Vinci Robotic System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) and the Zeus Robotic System1 (formerly Computer Motion, Inc., now part of Intuitive Surgical). In order to generate high gripping forces at the end-effectors while maintaining small instrument sizes, the power transmission mechanisms in these systems are designed in such a way that the motors are placed outside the human body. The da Vinci Robotic system uses a tendon-driven mechanism, and the Zeus Robotic system uses a serial linkage mechanism for transmitting the power from the motors to the end-effector. The da Vinci system has an instrument diameter of 8 mm, and includes a robotic wrist at the end of the instruments that provide articulated motions with 6 DOFs2 of movement inside the chest cavity, in contrast to the Zeus system that has an instrument diameter of 5 mm, but lacks a fully articulated (i.e., 2 DOFs) wrist allowing only 5 DOFs inside the chest cavity. The Zeus system, on the other hand, requires a signiﬁcantly smaller incision to be made on the body over the da Vinci system. More recently, 5-mm-diameter instruments with full 6 DOFs have been available for the da Vinci system. However, these instruments use a nonspherical wrist, which result in reduced dexterity. The same general relationship between the number of DOFs of a surgical manipulator and its tool shaft diameter holds for the other robotic laparoscopic surgery systems reported in the literature as well (for a recent review, refer to [2]).

If the robot has a multi-DOF wrist, then the number of DOFs for the end-effector can be increased, which allows the surgeon to perform the surgery with more dexterity. A conﬂicting objective is to reduce the diameter of the multi-DOF robotic surgical instruments to allow their use in variety of applications, including minimally invasive pediatric, neonatal, and fetal surgery. Due to the present actuator technologies available for the endeffector and power transmission for orienting the end-effector, it is difﬁcult to design a multi-DOF wrist for orienting the endeffector of a 5-mm-diameter robotic instrument for MIS. If we can integrate a local actuating system with the end-effector itself, this would simplify the wrist design, facilitating the construction of wrists with higher DOFs at smaller diameters, as we can eliminate the transmission of the mechanical power through the wrist to the end-effector. Developing a device for local actuation is, therefore, an important enabling technology for designing new tools for MIS.
There are a number of earlier works in the literature that focused on the design of robotic end-effectors with integrated actuators, including compliant and ﬂexure-based grippers [3], [4], instruments with embedded sensors [5], [6], and end-effectors employing SMA and other microactuators [7]–[9]. However, none of these system designs satisﬁes the requirements of this application.
In this paper, the design of a novel hybrid actuator driven by a miniature brushless dc motor and shape memory alloy (SMA) actuator is presented to overcome the present limitations of current MIS tools. The developed hybrid actuator is used to actuate a 5-mm-diameter endoscopic needle driver (adapted from a manual endoscopic needle driver manufactured by Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.) that will be used as an end-effector in a robotic telesurgical system for minimally invasive cardiothoracic surgery. The designed actuator is 5.14 mm in diameter (including the casing) and 40 mm in length, and is used to actuate 20-mm-long needle driver assembly, while generating a force of 24 N, resulting in a gripping force of 8 N. The total stroke length of the actuator is 1 mm, which results in a 45◦ opening of the needle driver jaw with a gap of 8 mm in between the jaws.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The design requirements and a review of alternative actuation technologies is presented in Section II, followed by the presentation of the design principles of the proposed hybrid actuator in Section III. The method used to determine the SMA actuator force–displacement characteristics is presented in Section IV. The design and experimental evaluation results of the ﬁrst- and second-generation hybrid actuator prototypes are discussed in Section V and VI, respectively, followed by concluding remarks in Section VII.
II. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
A. Design Requirements
The goal of the design is to develop a millimeter-scale actuator that can be used locally to actuate laparoscopic needle driver jaws, thereby facilitating the development of a multi-DOF wrist and developing a robot with more DOFs for performing MIS.

TABLE I DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ACTUATOR
The requirements for the millimeter-scale actuator used during the design are summarized in Table I. The actuator should be 5 mm in diameter so that it can ﬁt through the 5-mm trocars. The gripping force needs to be sufﬁciently large to hold the needle while suturing. The minimum gripping force requirement was determined based on simple experiments done with the speciﬁc needle driver used as the end-effector. This value is consistent with the values used in [10], and in [11], for the Silver Falcon system. The stroke length of the actuator is also determined from the speciﬁc needle driver used as the end-effector so as to result in a 45◦ opening of the needle driver jaw.
The wrist-to-gripper length of the manipulator has implications in terms of the dexterity of the manipulator, where a shorter wrist-to-gripper length typically results in smaller joint velocities during surgical manipulation. Therefore, the length of the end-effector should be as short as possible so that it can be attached to a spherical wrist of a robot performing MIS. However, in this study, we chose to focus on the diameter of the actuator rather than on the overall length, as there are types of minimally invasive surgical operations where the instrument diameter is critical, and there are no existing designs that can satisfy their requirements, as discussed in Section I. The speciﬁed minimum cycle time for the gripper actuation is chosen speciﬁcally for needle driving applications where the needle is held for long durations once it is properly grabbed, in contrast to manipulations, such as dissection, which requires much more end-effector openings–closings.
B. Comparison of Various Design Alternatives
Several different microactuator technologies were considered to achieve the design requirements [12]–[15]. From the comparison chart shown in Table II, it can be seen that the amount of force generated per unit volume is high for piezoelectric and SMA actuators. But the amount of stroke produced by piezoelectric actuators is signiﬁcantly lower than that produced by the other alternatives. One method used to improve the stroke length of piezoelectric actuators is to construct an inchworm mechanism. A 7-mm-diameter actuator is designed in [16] by using piezoelectric crystals to operate as an inchworm actuator to drive the laparoscopic needle driver. This actuator can only be inserted through 8-mm or larger diameter trocars as compared to the 5-mm trocar in our present design. A major issue with piezoelectric inchworm actuators is extremely small tolerances required during manufacturing for the actuator to operate properly.
SMA wires were used in the design of different actuators [17]–[19] for many applications. Silent actuation is a positive

attribute that allows the use of SMA in medical applications. But, the major problem with the use of an SMA actuator is its low cycle speed and low stroke length. Its efﬁciency is low, requiring a large power to actuate. However, in the present application, power is not an issue.
Another alternative actuator technology choice is dc micromotors, which have a good speed and large stroke, but a low output torque. With the advances in miniaturization and the production of miniature brushless dc motors with microgearbox, the feasibility of using dc motors in miniature applications has increased. Micro dc motors have been investigated in [21]–[23] as a linear actuator in the design of miniature medical devices.
No single actuator technology can be employed to satisfy the requirements speciﬁed in Table I. Each of the actuator types discussed earlier (and presented in Table II) has shortcomings in some of the aspects.
Both the SMA and dc micromotor have positive attributes and drawbacks for designing the millimeter-scale actuator. In this paper, we propose a design solution that combines SMA and dc micromotors in a hybrid fashion in complimentary roles harvesting the positive attributes and overcoming the drawbacks of both these actuator technologies.
III. DESIGN PRINCIPLE OF THE HYBRID ACTUATOR
The proposed novel hybrid actuator design consists of two stages: a dc micromotor stage and an SMA actuator stage. The two stages of the hybrid actuator are connected in series, and it works as a two-phase actuator. The dc micromotor stage is composed of a dc micromotor and a leadscrew connected to its rotor shaft with a rotational bearing. The bearing is for protecting the dc micromotor from the large axial forces generated by the SMA actuator stage, and the lead-screw and nut assembly is for converting the rotational motion of the motor to linear motion. The SMA actuator stage is composed of several SMA wires

and a preloading spring connected in a mechanically parallel fashion, and is connected to the nut of the lead-screw and nut assembly of the dc micromotor stage.
Each of the two stages are used in roles that harvest the corresponding actuator technology’s advantages while avoiding the shortcomings. The dc micromotor stage is used for opening and closing action of the gripper jaws, as this action requires large strokes (in the order of 1 mm) but signiﬁcantly smaller forces (in the order of 1 N). The SMA actuator stage is used for gripping and holding the needle, as this action requires substantial forces (about 15 N for gripping force of 5 N) but relatively short strokes (only enough to handle the structural deformations). Both the SMA actuator and the dc motor are actuated in closing the needle driver jaws to hold the suture needle, and only the dc motor is actuated in opening the needle driver jaws.
A. Closing the Needle Driver Jaws
The hybrid actuator operates in two phases during needle grasping action. In the ﬁrst phase of actuation, as shown in Fig. 1(b), the dc motor rotates in counterclockwise direction, and moves the needle driver jaws from the open position to the closed position. In the second phase of the actuation [Fig. 1(c)], when the jaws reach the closed position, the dc motor is stopped, and the SMA actuator is actuated by heating the array of parallel SMA wires by applying an electrical current. At this position,

the force exerted by the needle driver jaws is at the peak value. The force generated by the SMA actuator is enough for the needle driver jaws to hold the needle for performing suturing. When the SMA actuator is activated, it does not backdrive the dc micromotor as the lead-screw nut assembly is not backdrivable because of the friction and pitch of the lead-screw.
B. Opening the Needle Driver Jaws
For opening the jaws of the needle driver (Fig. 2), the SMA actuator is switched off ﬁrst. After the SMA actuator is cooled down, the dc motor is rotated in clockwise direction. The clockwise rotation of the screw causes the SMA actuator to move in the forward direction. Because of the short delay between the turning off of the SMA current and the starting of the dc micromotor to open the gripper, to allow for the cooling of the SMA, the SMA will not be applying a force when the dc micromotor is activated. Since the SMA wires cannot transmit the compressive forces, a preloaded spring is used to transmit the forces generated by the dc motor to open the needle driver jaws. As the motor continues to rotate, the needle driver jaws open up. The dc motor is switched off after the jaws open up.
IV. SMA CHARACTERISTICS
In the construction of SMA stages of the actuator prototypes, we have used off-the-shelf 0.154-mm-diameter nickel–titanium SMA wires (Flexinol, Dynalloy, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). However, the detailed force versus stroke length characteristics of the SMA wires, which is critical to determine the tolerances and the structural stiffness requirements of the mechanical design, were not available from the manufacturer. The following experimental setup and methodology was used to determine the characteristic curve. It has been included here as it may be of interest to the readers who need to determine similar characteristics for their own applications.

The experimental setup shown in Fig. 3 is constructed to obtain the force versus stroke length characteristics of the SMA wire. One end of the SMA wire that will be characterized is connected to a ﬁxture that is ﬁrmly ﬁxed to a base plate, while the other end of the SMA wire is connected to a force gauge through a cylindrical connector and a ﬂexible wire.3 Initially, the force gauge is moved with the help of a micrometer in the direction that increases the tensile force in the SMA wire. As soon as the force gauge reading shows 0.5 N (to make the SMA wire taut), the movement is stopped, and the movable stopper is moved to transfer the load from the force gauge to the stopper. This is done by placing a shim in between the connector and the stopper, and moving the stopper toward the connector until the force gauge shows a reading of 0 N. Then, the SMA wire is actuated by passing current through it and heating it to 75–80 ◦C.4 At this point, the SMA wire is actuated with both of its ends constrained, so the force generated in the SMA wire is approximately equal to the maximum force it can generate with zero strain. In order to measure this force value, the force gauge is slowly moved away from the stopper until the shim inserted in between the connector and the stopper falls, at which point the force gauge reading is approximately equal to the force generated in the SMA wire. The corresponding value of the micrometer reading is taken down. Once the initial reading is obtained for zero stroke length, the stopper is moved toward the ﬁxture by a known displacement. Following this, the force gauge is moved toward the stopper, with the shim placed in between the connector and the stopper, until its reading becomes zero, transferring all the load back to the stopper. The force gauge is, then, again moved away from the stopper till the shim falls off. At this point, the reading on the gauge shows the force generated by the SMA wire for the displacement equal to the displacement of the stopper from its initial position. This process is then repeated for several displacement values of the stopper to obtain a set of force readings for the set of known stroke lengths.
3The stiffness of the supporting structure for holding the SMA ﬁxture is measured before carrying the experiment, and is found to be very high for the forces applied during the experiment. Therefore, the supporting structure is treated as a rigid structure as the deformation at this end is negligible.
4The temperature of the SMA wire is measured using a temperature probe (FLUKE 80TK, Fluke Electronics, Everett, WA).

Fig. 4 Force versus stroke length characteristics of the SMA wire (0.154-mmdiameter wire).

We can determine the required structural stiffness and manufacturing tolerances of the actuator mechanism from Fig. 4. For example, the 0.154-mm-diameter SMA wire can generate a force of 4 N for a stroke strain of 0.8%. This means that an SMA actuator with eight SMA wires, each one 30 mm in length, connected mechanically in parallel can generate a minimum combined force of 32 N if the SMA actuator structure allows a maximum movement of approximately 0.25 mm from structural deformations and miscellaneous tolerances in the mechanism.

V. DESIGN OF THE FIRST-GENERATION ACTUATOR PROTOTYPE
During the design of the ﬁrst-generation hybrid actuator prototype, the main design objective was to minimize the overall dimensions of the actuator pack, while still satisfying the minimum force output requirements, at the expense of mechanism complexity.
As shown in Fig. 5, the millimeter-scale actuator prototype consists of a 3.4-mm-diameter and 12.22-mm-long brushless dc motor (Smoovy BL2S3.025.R.0, MPS Micro Precision Systems AG, Bienne, Switzerland) with a planetary gear reduction of 1:25. The 3.4-mm motor is connected to a 1.46-mm-diameter screw, with a pitch of 80 threads per inch, through a connector [Fig. 5(d)]. The connector acts as a bearing, and isolates the motor from any axial forces that are produced when the SMA actuator is actuated. The torque generated by the dc motor with 1:25 reduction gear train, as per the speciﬁcations provided in the data sheets, is 0.42 mN·m.
The SMA actuator consists of a 0.1524-mm-diameter SMA wire wound around the cylindrical Torlon (Solvay Advanced Polymers, LLC) structure through holes, as shown in Fig. 5(b). Torlon is used to fabricate the SMA actuator structure as it can withstand high temperatures, has good mechanical properties, and can be machined easily. This SMA wire acts as six individual SMA wires connected mechanically in parallel. The SMA actuator is preloaded with a spring to provide necessary reverse bias force to the SMA wire, as shown in Fig. 5(b). As the SMA wire cannot transmit compressive forces, the loaded spring transmits the compressive force required for opening of the gripper. The total length of the SMA wire used in the actua-

tor is 150 mm, and the length of each individual wire connecting the SMA actuator is 25 mm.
The designed prototype is interfaced to a computer through the printer port for controlling the motion of the gripper. The software code for generating the required signals is written in C++. The motor is controlled by a manufacturer controller (Smoovy BLCPS.000.2.8, MPS Micro Precision Systems AG, Bienne, Switzerland), and the required input signals for the controller are generated by the computer. The SMA actuator is controlled by switching an electromechanical relay ON and OFF

460

IEEE/ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS, VOL. 12, NO. 4, AUGUST 2007

through the computer. First, the dc motor is actuated by giving a pulse signal to the input of the controller. Each pulse signal makes the dc motor rotate by 60◦, and a total of 520 pulses are required to close/open the gripper. The total time taken by the dc motor to close the gripper is 1.5 s. The gripping force generated by this setup with a 10-mm-long needle driver jaw is 5.5 N, as measured at a distance of approximately 7.5 mm (three fourths of jaw length) from the gripper joint. This shows that the actual force generated by the SMA actuator is around 15 N, as there is a reduction in the force applied to the force exerted by the needle driver.
The ﬁrst-generation actuator prototype is a rather compact design, as the linear displacement (i.e., dc micromotor stage) and the force-generation (i.e., SMA actuator) stages overlap partially. However, this design results in manufacturing and assembly issues, which result from the complicated moving parts. In particular, the performance of the linear stage is very sensitive to the alignment of the motor shaft and the connector, and therefore, results in machining and assembly difﬁculties. This can be overcome by using a ﬂexible coupling between the motor shaft and the connector, which, however, signiﬁcantly complicates the overall design at this scale. The second issue with the ﬁrst-generation design concerns the casing of the actuator. As shown in Fig. 5(c), the casing for the hybrid actuator consists of a bearing support structure to hold the actuator assembly in place and protect the motor from axial forces. The casing is made of steel, as the thickness of the casing needs to be very thin, and it has to provide structural stability to the actuator assembly. The idea of Teﬂon coating on the inner side of the casing was pursued in order to electrically isolate the SMA wires from the casing. Given the tight tolerances of the parts, the Teﬂon coating can be only on the order of micrometer thickness. At this thickness, it is very difﬁcult to control the density and uniformity of the Teﬂon coating resulting in a signiﬁcant manufacturing challenge. Therefore, a second-generation hybrid actuator was designed to overcome these problems.
VI. DESIGN OF THE SECOND-GENERATION HYBRID ACTUATOR
The second-generation actuator is designed in such a way that the assembly of the various parts inside the actuator is simple, and all the parts can be assembled inside a 4.6-mm inner diameter casing. As shown in Fig. 6, the constructed ﬁnal actuator is 5.14 mm in diameter and approximately 60 mm in length. The outer casing needs to be very thin and should provide structural support to the actuator assembly. The outer casing for the hybrid actuator is fabricated out of Celazol (Quadrant Engineering Plastic Products, Reading, PA), as Celazol has better mechanical properties when compared to Torlon in terms of tensile strength and operating temperature.
A. Design of the SMA Actuator Stage
The SMA actuator stage of the second-generation prototype, as shown in Fig. 7, consists of a lower ﬁxture, an upper ﬁxture, a spring holder, and a spring. The major and minor diameters of the lower ﬁxture and upper ﬁxture are 4.2 and 3.2 mm, respectively. Lower and upper ﬁxtures for the SMA actuator are

fabricated from Torlon material. Torlon was selected for fabricating the SMA actuator as it can withstand high temperatures, can be machined easily, and isolates the SMA wires electrically. The lower ﬁxture contains 0.3-mm-diameter holes to hold the SMA wire and for tying a knot to secure the ends of the SMA actuator. The spring holder acts as a housing for the spring that is used to provide reverse bias force to the SMA wire. The end of the spring holder that goes into the lower ﬁxture contains a threaded hole to move the SMA actuator linearly when the screw shaft on the linear actuator is rotated. The spring holder for the actuator is made of brass. The reason for using brass to fabricate the spring holder is that it acts as a heat sink for the SMA actuator, and provides low friction between the screw and the threaded hole. There is a clearance between the spring holder casing and the inner diameter of the upper ﬁxture, so that the spring holder can slide inside the upper ﬁxture. Upper ﬁxture is also fabricated from Torlon, and it holds and connects the SMA actuator to the needle driver.
Fig. 7(b) shows an exploded view of the SMA actuator. During the assembly of the SMA actuator, the spring holder and the lower ﬁxture are ﬁrst joined together by applying instant adhesive. Then, the assembly of the spring holder and lower ﬁxture is loaded into the upper ﬁxture with the spring in between them. This assembly is loaded into the SMA weaving instrument for holding the components of the SMA actuator in position, under the compressive force of the loaded spring, as shown in Fig. 7(d). The SMA weaving instrument is made of Torlon material. In order to provide the reverse bias force on the SMA wire, the assembly of the lower ﬁxture, spring holder, and the upper ﬁxture are locked in a position by a positioning pin such that the spring is compressed in between the lower ﬁxture and the upper ﬁxture. Once the position of the assembly is secured in

tion, Rocky Hill, CT) is applied on the knot to make sure that the SMA wire remains in position once the positioning pin is removed. Thermal resistive adhesive is used because the temperature of the SMA wire reaches approximately 80 ◦C during the operation of the SMA actuator. Once the adhesive is cured, the positioning pin is removed, and the SMA actuator is removed by pushing it from the bottom of the SMA weaving instrument with a long thin rod.

B. Design of the Linear Actuator Stage
The linear actuator stage of the hybrid actuator consists of a 1.4-mm-diameter screw with a pitch of 0.3175 mm that is rotated by a micromotor, as shown in Fig. 8(a). The micromotor used in this hybrid actuator is a 4-mm-outer-diameter motor (SBL04-0829PG18, Namiki Precision Jewel Company, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) consisting of a 4-mm-diameter gearbox with a reduction ratio of 1:18. The reason for selecting the Namiki motor over the Smoovy motor used in the ﬁrst-generation prototype is that the output speed and the amount of output torque generated by the Namiki motor are greater than that by the Smoovy motor. The total length of the motor is 18 mm including the length of the shaft. A hole of 0.8-mm diameter and 3-mm length is drilled into the end containing the head of the screw. The motor shaft is slid through this hole, and instant adhesive from Loctite (411 PRISM, Henkel Corporation, Rocky Hill, CT) is applied to hold the motor shaft and the screw.
As shown in Fig. 8(b), a key is attached to the casing of the motor. The screw and the motor assembly are slid into the motor holder such that the key on the motor casing is in between the key way of the motor holder. The key attached to the casing of the motor prevents the motor casing from rotating, but allows it to move linearly. The motor supporting structure is ﬁxed to the end of the motor holder to ﬁx the motor inside the motor holder. A small clearance is left in between the motor and the supporting structure so that the motor can slide by a fraction of a millimeter. The main advantage of this type of motor assembly is that the motor shaft is free from any high axial load that is generated during the operation of the SMA actuator, as the entire load is taken by the screw head.

C. Assembly Procedure
During the assembly, the SMA actuator is ﬁrst attached to the sliding link of the needle driver, as shown in Fig. 6(c). A connecting pin is used to connect the sliding link and the SMA actuator. There is clearance provided in between the sliding link and the connecting pin, so that the connecting pin can freely pivot over the sliding link. There is a tight ﬁt between the SMA upper ﬁxture and the connecting pin; as a result, the connecting pin stays with the upper ﬁxture of the SMA actuator.
After assembling the SMA actuator and needle driver, the casing is assembled by applying adhesive between the needle driver and the inner surface of the casing. Then, the linear actuator is connected to the drive circuit and is rotated in the anticlockwise direction. Rotation of the linear actuator in the clockwise direction makes the screw advance in the forward direction into the SMA actuator. Once the linear actuator is inside the outer

casing, adhesive is applied to attach the linear actuator to the casing ﬁrmly.
D. Experimental Results
A plot of the signals required for one complete cycle of the second-generation hybrid actuator is shown in Fig. 9. First, the dc motor is actuated by giving an input signal to the input of the Namiki motor drive unit (SSD04). Namiki motor drive drives the motor in open loop as the motor does not have any feedback sensors. The total time taken by the dc motor to close the gripper is 0.4 s (tclose). The direction of rotation of the dc motor depends on the direction signal. At the end of 0.4 s, after the gripper closes, the SMA actuator is actuated by switching an electromechanical relay switch ON. The SMA actuator is actuated while the gripper needs to hold the needle, for a time of thold seconds. The amount of gripping force applied on a needle located at approximately 7.5 mm (three-fourths of jaw length) from the gripper joint is 8 N. The dc motor is not actuated

immediately after switching OFF the SMA actuator. It is rather actuated after a time delay of 1 s (tsleep). The time delay is necessary to make sure that the SMA actuator has relaxed and is not applying a high axial force on the linear actuator. At the end of the tsleep seconds, the dc motor is actuated to open the gripper jaws. The dc motor rotates in the clockwise direction as the direction signal changes from 0 to 5 V. The total time required for one complete cycle excluding the duration while holding the needle is 1.8 s. This cycle time includes the time tsleep required for cooling down of the SMA. A video of the tests of the system is provided for view in [24].
VII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
This paper addressed the need for a local actuation system to actuate the end-effector of a robot performing MIS. We discussed a novel design idea for developing a hybrid actuator as a local actuation system. The force versus stroke length characteristics are determined for the SMA wire used in the design of the actuator. We developed a prototype to test the feasibility of the design idea, and tested it to determine the amount of gripping force generated. The resulting performance values for the two generations of hybrid actuator designs are summarized in Table III.
There is a large scope of improvements for this hybrid actuator to increase its performance. Presently, the actuator operates as a feedforward device without any position feedback. One improvement that can be done in this area is to use microposition sensors to get feedback of the absolute position of the end-effector opening angle. The amount of force required for holding the needle is different from the force required to hold the tissue. So, if microforce sensors can be embedded onto the needle driver jaws, the SMA actuator can be controlled to generate appropriate amount of force based on whether it has to

hold the needle or the tissue. These two additions would allow a completely analog control of the hybrid actuator.
Presently, the outer casing of the actuator is fabricated from Celazol, which is an electrical and thermal insulator. This material was speciﬁcally chosen to provide the thermal and electrical insulation necessary for the safety of the end-effector. As a result, the performance of the actuator may be reduced if the SMA actuator is switched ON for long time, due to overheating of the internal parts of the actuator. In the current prototype, the heat is dissipated by convection. Because of the high thermal resistivity of the casing, we have not observed any signiﬁcant temperatures at the surface of the actuator assembly. However, this may become an issue if a metallic casing is used, and therefore, needs to be considered if such a design will be employed. The heat generation by the SMA wire can be a safety concern for regulatory approval, especially for the case of a metallic casing. This can be handled by placing a temperature sensor inside the actuator unit. The improvement in SMA cooling efﬁciency would also help to decrease the cycle time of the actuator.
Another design possibility is to construct the outer casing using brass or surgical steel, coating the interior surface with a very thin layer (sufﬁciently thick to provide adequate electric insulation) of Teﬂon. Unlike the ﬁrst-generation prototype, where Teﬂon coating of the interior of the casing was difﬁcult because of the presence of a bearing, this is rather straightforward for the second-generation prototype as there is no bearing, or any other additional structures, present on the inner surface of the casing that would make coating difﬁcult.
Maintaining reliable electrical connection with SMA wires is a common issue in SMA actuator applications. In the limited test that we have performed with our prototype, we have not observed any issues with knots; however, we have not performed extensive reliability tests for electrical connections. This is an issue that needs to be kept in mind for the application of the technology. Mechanical clamping or welding are two potential candidates for consideration if the proposed hybrid actuator is to be mass-produced. The welding of SMA typically results

in change of shape memory properties locally, but it is not expected to effect performance of the proposed hybrid actuator as the location where the connection is made does not need to be carrying a load.
The present design uses a needle driver unit adapted from an off-the-shelf endoscopic needle driver instrument, and is not designed to give optimum performance for use with the hybrid actuator. If a custom gripper is designed for the hybrid actuator, it can decrease the overall length of the actuator and can increase the amount of force applied.
The overall outer diameter of the second-generation actuator, together with the casing, is slightly above the design speciﬁcations given in Table I. The main reason for this is the clearance required to attach the actuator outer casing to the off-the-shelf needle driver unit. If the needle driver was custom-built, together with the actuator outer casing, instead of adapting a needle driver unit from a commercial manual instrument, the outer diameter speciﬁcation would be very easily satisﬁed. However, we chose not to pursue this option as this would have been a distraction from the actual research topic of the design of the hybrid actuator.
The required gripping force of the actuator is an important design variable, and depends on the needle driver jaw size and texture, the needle size and shape, and the type of tissue that the tissue will be driven into. Therefore, it might be necessary to have higher gripping forces for some applications (e.g., [25]). It is rather straightforward to increase the gripping force for the proposed design of the hybrid actuator by increasing the number or diameters of the SMA wires used. However, it is important to note that using SMA wires of larger diameters will lead to longer cool-off times.
The cost of the developed prototype is an important concern for the feasibility of a commercial product using the design. Costs of the micromotors and sensors at this scale are likely to decrease, especially as production numbers escalate. For example, micromotors with slightly larger sizes are commercially available for about US $0.50, since they are widely used as vibrators in cell phones.
The goal of the proposed end-effector design is to enable the development of 6-DOF surgical manipulators with spherical wrists and tool shaft diameters of 5 mm, which has not been possible in any commercial or research systems developed so far (see Section I). We believe this is the value added of the proposed design, and may or may not justify the increased cost and complexity from using the proposed end-effector based on the application. Furthermore, the premise of the proposed design is that routing of electrical cables through a wrist to power the local actuator would be smaller, easier, and cheaper than is designing a system where mechanical power is routed through the wrist, which may not even be possible for a 5-mm-diameter wrist.
The present research work was only focused on the design of the local actuation system, and did not look into the design of a spherical wrist for minimally invasive robotic surgery (MIRS) applications. Future research work will proceed toward the design of a spherical wrist that employs the developed locally actuated end-effector design.
