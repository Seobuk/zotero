Abstract: This paper mainly focuses on various types of robots driven or actuated by shape memory alloy (SMA) element in the last decade which has created the potential functionality of SMA in robotics technology, that is classiﬁed and discussed. The wide spectrum of increasing use of SMA in the development of robotic systems is due to the increase in the knowledge of handling its functional characteristics such as large actuating force, shape memory effect, and super-elasticity features. These inherent characteristics of SMA can make robotic systems small, ﬂexible, and soft with multi-functions to exhibit different types of moving mechanisms. This article comprehensively investigates three subsections on soft and ﬂexible robots, driving or activating mechanisms, and artiﬁcial muscles. Each section provides an insight into literature arranged in chronological order and each piece of literature will be presented with details on its conﬁguration, control, and application.
Keywords: shape memory alloy; robotics; actuation; sensing; control
1. Introduction Shape memory alloy (SMA) is a class of smart material wherein it undergoes changes
in its length by contracting to nearly 4% and thereby generates a huge amount of resistance force on its thermal actuation. This property of response to thermal stimuli in this alloy makes it smart, unlike the other alloys. There are types of different compositions of SMAs Ni-Ti alloy (Nitinol), Cu–Al–Ni alloy, Cu–Zn–Al alloy, Au–Cd alloy, Ni–Mn –Ga, and Fe based alloys. Only two alloys that have achieved any level of commercial exploitation are Ni-Ti alloys and copper-based alloys. SMA can operate under two different stimuli, one is thermal stimuli wherein, when a pre-stressed SMA wire (detwinned martensite) undergoes a change in temperature to its safe heating temperature (trained temperature) it remembers its parent shape(austenite) along with the stress it will resume back to its product state and this is called the shape memory effect. This type of feature is used for many position/angle tracking control applications. The other one is stress, where the stimulus at the safe heating temperature acts like a spring enabling it to dissipate a huge amount of energy and making it the right choice for use as dampers and absorbers.
In the early stages of SMA literature, the use of proportional derivatives was handled to operate in the systems but later on, it started to be drift to the implementation of nonlinear controllers or hybrid controllers. The control methods implemented on the

SMA-based system are mostly implemented using linear controls if the system demands just the actuation and does not need any precision or accuracy. However, there are complex systems, like when using to an instrument in higher-order systems it demands a nonlinear control for performance and efﬁcacy at higher rates. With a wide understanding of the inherent characteristics, there has been immense growth in terms of literature reports and commercial growth [1–7]. Position control in shape memory alloy (SMA) has been researched only in the last two decades and it has been growing in different areas starting from the design and development of a servo type of operation using the aSMA element in different conﬁgurations and by using different biasing elements. The different aspects of using the element to control position and force for robotic and haptic systems are also treated as principal parameters. Some of the features that are to be noted in developing an SMA-based system are to ﬁrst to ﬁrst determine the functionality that is going to operate on the system, composition of the element, structural form, and biasing element. Even though SMA is a non-linear element, there are reports in which it has been noted that the output response of the system remains linear in operation. This behavior is undertaken using an active biasing element which is an antagonistic SMA actuator and the way to make it linear is determined by choosing the inverse mechanical element. In other words, the proper selection of biasing elements can be able to maintain the linearity in the response [8].
The main scope of this article is to timely present a state-of-art on mechanical arrangement of the SMA element along with the biasing, which will eventually provide useful guidelines to design more advanced designs for robotic systems. The control strategies that are mostly and frequently employed in SMA-based robots can be classiﬁed into two categories: passive control and active control. In the passive control, ON/OFF control and PWM (pulse width modulation) control are dominant in which the actuating force is converted to the stroke or position of the robotic systems. On the other hand, in the active control, PID (proportional-integral-derivative) control and modiﬁed PID control logic such as fuzzy-PID control are frequently used for precise position feedback control of small and soft robots.
The manuscript has three sections they are ﬂexible/soft robots, drivers and servo actuators, and artiﬁcial muscles. At the start of each section there is a brief deﬁnition, followed by the literature papers in chronological order stating the mechanism, movement, control, and the application for which it is built.
2. Flexible and Soft Robots
Soft robotics were developed using bio-inspired compliance to mimic animal or human capabilities Flexible actuators and electronics are employed to design soft robots. Soft robots are made almost entirely of rigid-body architectures out of ﬂexible, soft material, making them suitable for applications in uncertain, dynamic task environments, including safe human-robot interactions with excellent ﬂexibility and adaptability, but their load capacity is limited [9,10]. The ﬂexibility of SMAs allows us to build actuation components in different conﬁgurations and shapes (e.g., helical springs, torsion springs, straight wires, cantilever strips, and torsion tubes), which allow them to be adapted to small, micro, and multi-DOF (degree-of-freedom) applications. Their high force-to-weight ratio and small volume (i.e.) SMA displays one of the highest work densities at 10 J cm−3 and can lift more than 100 times its weight—allowing the design of compact and lightweight actuators.
The generic mechanical design for an SMA-based soft robot is an SMA element, which can be a wire or a spring or any other available conﬁguration followed by a biasing element which in soft robotics will be the chassis material by itself or passive, to enable cyclic operation in the SMA element, and the powering mechanism which is usually a joules heating current. In this section, we can discuss the various design, conﬁgurations of SMA elements, and control of the SMA actuator in soft robots [4]. The control is mostly on/off as they focus more on the type of motion to generate using SMA elements.
In early 2010, FlexiBot (Flexible Robotic Module) was designed with two degrees of freedom and incorporated four memory alloy (SMA) springs as shown in Figure 1a, to

create relative motion between two parallel plates hinged to each other providing 30-degree displacements, which make them more suitable for robotic applications [11]. A four-legged robot [12] was created and actuated by SMA wires along with biasing springs to realize jumping motion as in Figure 1b. A ﬁnger-sized wood climbing robot [13] with SMA springs can exhibit the crawl, turn, and climb motion on a tree for search and rescue operations. Peristaltic motion [14] was realized by using the parallel conﬁguration of the SMA element for in-pipe movement as in Figure 1c which was designed to crawl for inspection purposes. A snake robot with three links [15] was designed with a PID-fuzzy controller. A biomimetic ﬁsh was actuated by SMA wires [16] in enabling bio-inspired locomotion systems using a deformable structure. The ﬁsh is controlled with gains set such that the voltage applied to SMA wires has minimum overshoot and the output of the system has minimal time to achieve stability. A novel climbing mode was developed in millirobots built with SMA wire along with a return spring to execute the climbing potential of the robot [17]. A ﬂexible pectoral ﬁn [18] uses two parallel SMA plates, which can perform a bi-directional bending action, and an elastic membrane made of thin rubber, is adhered to the ﬁn rays to function as a bias element. Flea-inspired catapults with SMA springs were used as actuators that can jump more than 200 times their body length with impulse current stimuli [19]. A biomimetic walking microrobot was designed using 11 ICPF (ionic conducting polymer ﬁlm) actuators to move and two SMA wire actuators to change motion attitude enabling two kinds of motion attitudes: lying state and standing state [20]. A structure with eight SMA springs was developed to have a helical muscular arrangement to simulate the motion of an octopus muscular hydrostat [21]. A compact external pipe crawler robot [22] was designed by deploying a compliant mechanism and SMA actuation that follows clamp-andpush motion and imitates inchworm motion. A soft robot exhibiting sequential antagonistic motion [23] is achieved in a ﬂexible braided mesh-tube structure using nickel-titanium (NiTi) coil actuators wrapped in a spiral pattern around the circumference that exhibits peristaltic locomotion. Starﬁsh-like robots driven by shape SMA spring actuators [24] were designed to accomplish crawling on ﬂat ground, climbing over viscous soil terrain, free motions in random directions, navigating through a target object, and steering as well as grasping imaginary prey as shown in Figure 1d. A ﬂexible microrobot module (FMM) was actuated by SMA springs [25] and able to provide both translational and rotational displacements. Stiquito hexapod mobile [26] robot was designed using antagonist active Nitinol (NiTi) SMA wire/passive music wire couples to produce moving insect-like legs. The starﬁsh-like soft robot with ﬂexible rays using SMA spring [27] with soft silicone material induces multi-gait movements in various environments. BaTboT, a novel bat-like MAV was studied to increase net body forces by implementing with highly articulated wings actuated by shape memory alloy actuators [28]. Soft caudal ﬁn actuators using SMAs [29] that are ﬁxed along with the soft structure of the caudal ﬁn and bend to a certain mode shape can perform steady swimming and maneuvering. The small one DOF mobile robot is actuated by a pair of SMA springs [30], and the developed mechanism can steer in addition to moving forward on a common plane. Bio-inspired multi-arm underwater robotic swimmers actuated by compliant SMA were modeled and developed by actuating spring elements [31]. A locomotive textile-based robotic system was weaved [32] wherein the fabric is integrated with a woven hybrid SMA-textile actuator based designed system. A soft compliant robot [33] exhibiting an inchworm type locomotion was built and tested. Single-caudal ﬁn propelled robot ﬁsh using shape memory alloy wire [34] were developed, as well as unique frog-inspired hind limb robots with SMA spring actuators [35] designed to jump. A biomimetic robotic worm was developed to perform a peristaltic motion by employing nine SMA springs in three sections of the soft robot [36]. A ﬂexible parallel robotic module was actuated by three SMA springs in between a triangular top and base plate connected by a universal joint at its centroid [37]. Shape Memory Alloy actuated controllable suction grippers were proposed and experimented with for a wall climbing hexapod [38]. Soft actuators used to perform actions such as bending, twisting and extending using SMA wires were embedded into actuators to power them [39]. A

A 2DOF soft robotic neck was developed and controlled [46] actuated by a flexible SMA based actuator that allows movements of inclination and orientation. PATRICK, a soft robotic brittle star [47] was the first untethered underwater soft robot using the SMA springs to actuate as in Figure 1e and it was built with a high dimensional actuation sp4aocfe1,7 allowing deeper exploration of planning and control principles.

Backbone Robot (ATBR) was built [43] as the manipulator backbone and actuator which utilized the SMA helix. Fuzzy logic control is implemented to control the displacement by currents for underwater robots in [44]. A scheme to drive multiple ﬂexible ﬁns, was presented and veriﬁed the feasibility on a ﬂexible robotic ﬁsh driven by SMA wire which is inspired by the swimming mode of devil ﬁsh, that was able to achieve more stable motion of the ﬁsh, and the movement of the whole ﬁsh body was more natural and ﬂexible [45]. A 2DOF soft robotic neck was developed and controlled [46] actuated by a ﬂexible SMA based actuator that allows movements of inclination and orientation. PATRICK, a soft robotic brittle star [47] was the ﬁrst untethered underwater soft robot using the SMA springs to actuate as in Figure 1e and it was built with a high dimensional actuation space, allowing deeper exploration of planning and control principles. SMALLBug, a crawling microrobot that can locomote at actuation frequencies of up to 20 Hz, was designed, fabricated and tested [48]. The robot is driven by an electrically powered 6 mg bending actuator that is composed of a thin SMA wire and a carbon-ﬁber piece that acts as a loading leaf-spring and four legs capable of generating anisotropic friction. The papers that reported or designed and developed SMA-based soft robots are presented (in chronological order) in the Table 1 which displays the control handle and the parameters that are measured for the particular application.

3. Drivers and Servo Actuations
SMA is an actuator that experiences reduced length enabling a displacement along with force to bring out the work done at that point. Here, the basic element to design is to have an SMA element and a biasing element which would be a passive spring or it can also be active by using SMA elements in an antagonistic conﬁguration to generate a bi-directional movement. The proper design and the understanding of its inherent property changes can enable design of a system with uni-directional or bi-directional linear or rotating movement and any point of application, which proves its use as a driving actuator by substitution in places of traditional classical actuators. An accurate self-sensing method [49] based on the SMA strain to resistance curves for the control of shape memory alloy (SMA) wires biased with passive spring to function as actuated ﬂexures were modeled. An SMA wire actuated gripper was developed [50] to convert the small linear displacement into the angular movement of the gripping ﬁngers to enable open and close functions. A compliant gripper using an SMA coil was fabricated [51] along with a middle ﬂexure joint replicating the behavior of a caterpillar locomotion. A MIniature SwitchAble (MISA) connection system for a stochastic modular robot was designed and implemented [52] which can be switched on and off by controlling four SMA spring actuators. A methodology of actuation to create ﬂow generation in a ﬂexible tube by inducing a variable pressure difference within the tube by external actuation by SMA wires was proposed in [53] shown in Figure 2a. A gripper with soft ﬁngers with 2-DoFs using silicone elastomer rods embedded with shape memory alloy actuators [54], displaying anthropopathic actions was created.
The sensor-less self-sensing circuit for positioning the 1-DOF manipulator arm using antagonistic self-sensing SMA wires as shown in Figure 2b by implementing fuzzy-PID control was proposed and a real-time experiment was performed [55]. An impact drive mechanism (IDM) using SMA wires for positioning applications was found in [56]. A joint with two degrees of freedom (DOF) driven by antagonistic SMA triple wires using a resistance feedback signal in a closed-loop was designed [57]. SMA wires were characterized to function as a High Phase Order Motor (HPOM) using PWM control [58]. A

gripper was designed for a robot arm with an anti-slipping control rule to avoid grabbing an unknown object with insufﬁcient force [59]. A conventional PID controller cascaded with a bilinear compensator, known as BPID, is found to be a promising alternative for controlling the position of the SMA actuator [60]. Antagonistic SMA wires were designed in a conﬁguration to the function as a servomechanism [61] for bidirectional control in a super-articulated system. Self-sensing antagonistic SMA wires were used to establish servo mechanism with bi-directional control in a 1-DOF manipulator arm [62]. A compliant differential SMA actuator [63], composed of two antagonistic SMA wires and a mechanical joint, were coupled with a torsion spring. The master-slave system was set up [64] in which the master is equipped with antagonistic SMA wires to perform the actions to control the 2-DOF slave and also to generate force feedback. A smart soft composite (SSC) hinge actuator using SMA wire in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix was embedded with segmented rigid components capable of a pure bending motion concentrated on speciﬁc sections of the actuator [65]. A SMA springs actuated gripper [66] is operated to close and open by applying voltage. A tendon-driven bending actuator [67] using smart soft composite (SSC) and SMA, and a sliding mechanism, which mimics ﬂexion of the human hand were designed. A SMA springs actuated gripper is operated to close and open by applying a voltage as in [68]. Active variable stiffness ﬁbers made from shape memory alloy and thermally responsive polymers that can move to a new position and then hold that position without requiring additional power was designed [69].
A SMA-based soft three-fingered curved gripper [70] was designed which is capable of lifting force nearly three times larger than the gripper. A SMA springs-based soft actuator module (SAM) [71] assembling a connected series of four SAM to develop a soft manipulator was designed, which is capable of three-dimensional spatial grasping motion. Finger-wearable haptic devices [72] for multi-DoF cutaneous force feedback driven by four SMA wires for tip-tilt mechanisms and the planar XY spring with four SMA helixes are employed. An artificial finger [73] is a reproduction of the human finger bone and phalangeal structure, actuated by SMA wires. Shape control [74] of compliant, articulated meshes created from shape memory alloy (SMA)-based linear actuators (Active Cells) capable of ~25% linear strain was explored as shown in Figure 2c. A gecko-like gripper [75] that uses series shape memory alloy (SMA) wire for actuation was created. A compact and modular rotary motor using embedded shape memory alloy (SMA) wire was developed as in [76]. The contraction/expansion of the SMA wires is transmitted as rotational motion that enables the motor to generate continuous rotation and provides higher torque with relatively short-length SMA wires. An antagonistically arranged SMA wire-based actuator was fabricated in [77], which can provide angular displacements in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions with compliance. Robotic grippers with multiple SMA wires in series along with cross-shear coupler to achieve a larger stroke of actuation were designed [78]. A control method for soft robots on predicting the bending force and RBF compensation to obtain accurate positiontracking performance with adjustable stiffness in both open- and closed-loop control systems was presented in [79].
A continuous bidirectional rotary motor driven by NiTi SMA mini springs was designed in [80]. It is noticeable that its torque/volume and torque/mass ratios are prominent when compared to other motors of the same class. An improved method was based on online data-driven control to drive the robot wrist joint driven by SMA [81]. An Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)-based modeling and control of a 1-DOF modular SMA-based rotary actuator with a compliant motion and fast response was proposed in [82]. A control algorithm for the inversion of the Preisach model for a SMA wire spring-biased actuator under time-varying stress produced accurate results and was computationally efﬁcient was formulated in [83]. A foldable nanosized shape memory actuator into 3D conﬁgurations presented in [84] can move around. A numerical was developed for reproducing the mechanical response to integration of the time evolution nonlinear equations governing the response of the SMA spring [85].

The soft ﬁnger is a closed-loop PID control system to achieve the desired deformation by introducing a camera as a vision sensor, to detect the bending deformation of the soft ﬁnger in real-time.

Bioinspired composite ﬁngers used SMA wires as self-locking joints to perform long-time and high-load grasping tasks with low power consumption as proposed in [112]. An Ionic glove, wearable over a robotic hand, was developed in [113] which contains sensing, computation, and actuation onboard use shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators integrated into an armband to gently squeeze the user’s arm when pressure is sensed in novel electro-ﬂuid. The types of literature that reported or designed and developed SMA-based actuator-based driving mechanisms are presented in Table 3 which displays the control handle and the parameters that are measured for the particular application.

5. Conclusions
In this review article, three major subclasses of SMA-based robotic systems were investigated and discussed: soft robots designed with ﬂexible actuators, driving mechanisms to bring out both translational and rotational movement, and vital parts (artiﬁcial human parts) for developing some elements to replace the human motor system for rehabilitation or exoskeleton module use. The review analysis of each subclass is summarized as follows. (1) The ﬂexible/soft robots mainly featuring the locomotive-legged kind of robots are most commonly designed and developed. For this, the most commonly used control strategies were traditional on/off control or passive control via the open-loop manner. For the open-loop control, the on/off time remains constant and the speed of operation cannot be changed without programming it. Therefore, the types of robots activated by passive control were functioned to jump, crawl, climb, and roll which can be easily operated by SMA wires/springs in combination with proper biasing elements. (2) In the driving mechanism, the SMA element is employed to independently develop as a mechanism to facilitate movement. Thus, it can either be open or closed and uni-direction as in linear translation and bi-directional movement. In this operation, we need a little more precision when compared to the movement of the soft /ﬂexible robots. One of the widely used controllers in the driving mechanism is the fuzzy-PID controller which can be incorporated with the knowledge of the system. (3) In the development of artiﬁcial skin/muscle, the controller must be a closed-loop system so that it can handle real-time movement of human motion and mostly this is designed to be a human interface device. For example, both position and speed should be precisely controlled in the SMA-based wrist exoskeleton mechanism using the feedback controllers such as fuzzy tuned controllers. In this ﬁeld, to develop more sophisticated human-machine interface devices that should guarantee a higher precision in terms of positioning and generating force, more robust feedback control strategies such as a sliding mode controller need to be implemented for SMA actuators.
It is ﬁnally concluded that one of the most signiﬁcant limitations of application of SMA to various types of robotic systems is a relatively slow response to input stimuli such as current/thermal input compared with other smart material actuators such as piezoelectric ceramic. The response of SMA is closely and directly related to the control bandwidth of application robotic systems exhibiting dynamic movement in a wide frequency spectrum. Recently, to resolve this problem, a new type of SMA activated by magnetic ﬁeld has been developed, but its application for control of robotic systems is burgeoning.
