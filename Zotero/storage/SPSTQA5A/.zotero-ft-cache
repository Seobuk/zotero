Erbao Dong, Min Xu, Shiwu Zhang, Jie Yang

Abstract—This paper presented a new hybrid linear actuator which has significant potential to achieve both large force and large displacement based on SMA wires and DC motors. There were one screw and two locking nuts used to accumulate the small displacements of SMA wire actuators. And the SMA wires were connected in parallel to enhance the force output. A system dynamic model of this hybrid actuator was made on the present study, which was composed by the constitutive model of the SMAs, the electrical and heat transfer behavior of SMA wires, and dynamics of the linear actuation system. Our study explored the accuracy of the model and illustrated the properties of the hybrid linear actuator prototype. Preliminary tests revealed that this kind of hybrid actuator prototype could output a driving force of at least 50N and a single step displacement of 3.34mm in one step cycle. The multi-steps operation frequency under ambient atmosphere was about 0.05Hz. Both numerical simulation and experimental investigation showed that this hybrid linear actuator could achieve large force and large displacement with high stepping accuracy like a step motor.
I. INTRODUCTION
Linear actuators were widely applied in many fields, such as modern industry, agriculture, defense, medicine and human daily life. With the rapid development of automation, especially bionic robots and unmanned smart vehicles, there were increased demands on several respects, such as small size, light weight, low operation noise, large output force, long displacement range and high control precision linear actuators [1-3].
Shape memory alloys (SMAs), one type of the most widely used smart materials, have many advantages, such as high power to weight ratio, high force output (the output stress can be as high as 500MPa), smooth and silent operation. It was considered as a potential smart material for the high performance linear actuator [4].
There are mainly two challenges of the SMA linear actuators. One is how to enlarge its displacement range, and the other is that how to improve its control precision. For the first problem, many people used SMA coils to instead of SMA wires, which could induce large deformation [5]. But the prominent decreased of force output and the difficulty of precision control limited furthermore applications of the SMA

coils. In order to enlarge its range without force depressed, many designs of SMA actuators had been intensely explored. The development of these actuators mainly depended on mechanical amplification by using long straight SMA fibers with pulley block, or through special intertwist methods [6, 7]. However, the complex and voluminous structures still limited their displacement ranges, and the difficulty of accurate controls also restricted their applicability.
For the second problem, some constitutive models [8-10] and feedback control methods had been reported [11-15]. The basic thermal-mechanical properties of SMAs could be understood by the constitutive models. However, the complex thermo-mechanical coupling characteristics of SMAs under constraint condition, incomplete phase transformation and dynamic loading were still hard to describe by present models. Thus, the behaviors of many kinds of SMA actuators were still difficult to exactly forecast.
This paper presented a new type of linear actuator combining SMA wirers and DC motors. The new actuator integrated advantages of both SMA wire actuators and DC motors. It could effectively conquer the difficulty of accurate control of SMA actuators and as a result, contribute to form a linear actuation system with low weight and compact structure as well as high force out and large displacement range.
II. STRUCTURE OF THE HYBRID ACTUATOR
A. Mechanical Structure
Figure 1 showed the components of the present hybrid actuator. Among them, the SMA wires (the blue and red lines) were symmetrically located on both sides of the middle block, which is made up to a differential actuator. And then the screw which transfers the force and displacement could be driven by SMA wires through the middle block. Additionally, DC motors on each side of middle block could drive the nuts through gear matching to lock the position of the screw.

B. Actuation Principle
The electric driven sequence of SMA wires and DC motors was showed in Figure 2. Once the left SMA wires were heated (austenitic phase) and the right were in low temperature (martensite phase), they could initiate the left shift of middle block, nuts and screw. After cooling the left SMA wires and heating the right SMA wires, the left SMA would transform into the martensite phase and the right SMA into the high-temperature austenite phase. Then the middle block would return to the original place, while the screw locked by the right nut, and the left nut driven by DC motor would follow the movement of middle block.

III. DYNAMICS MODELING OF THE HYBRID ACTUATOR
System dynamic model of the SMA-electric motor hybrid linear actuator was composed of SMA constitutive model with its phase transformation equations, convection heat transfer model of SMA by electrical heating and natural cooling, dynamics model of DC motor and its transmission system, dynamics model of crew-nut joint system.

A. SMA Differential Actuator Dynamics Model
There are two operations of SMA wires, shrinking actuation and extensing reposition. So the equations of the SMA wires and load are:

The SMA constitutive model shows the relationship between stress, strain, and temperature of SMAs. We chose the Brinson model[9] which was widely used in SMA actuation systems to describe the SMA wire’s constitutive law.

When the stretched SMA wire took place of martensite varies phase transformation from twined martensite to detwined martensite, the other side SMA wire transformed from detwined martensite to austenite by electrical heated. Also though Brinson’s model, equations(4) and (5) can be represented as

IV. CONTROL STRATEGY AND SIMULATION RESULTS

A. SMA wires control strategy
The SMA differential actuator composed with a middle block and two bunches of SMA wires both sides. When one side SMA wires were heated to drive the load, the other side must be cooled down. So the control strategy could given as figure 3 showed, the actuation SMA wire and reposition SMA wire alternates be heated and cooled. And in order to maximize the output force and assure a long service life, we heated the actuation SMA wires when the other side SMA wires’ temperature was under Mf.

The values for the necessary parameters were listed in table 1. Thus the response property of the hybrid linear actuator by one step movement simulation was shown in figure 4.

V. PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPERIMENTAL TESTS A. Prototype design and manufacture
The hybrid linear actuator composed of 6 SMAs and 2 DC motors was developed as shown in figure 5. The hybrid actuator contains many other components, such as the SMA differential actuating elements, the micro permanent magnet DC motor, the screw, the left and right locking nuts, the middle block and the rack. The SMA wires were made by Ni50.8%Ti material. Their diameters were 0.5 mm and the effective lengths were 150 mm. The two groups of SMA wires pulled the screw to achieve linear motion. The outer rings of the left and the right nuts were processed into gears to engage with the gear fixed on the output axis of the micro-magnet DC motor. The locking nut could be rotated by the DC motor and keep contact with the middle baffle to match the movement of the screw when the nuts were free.
Figure 5. The prototype of the SMA-motor hybrid linear actuator
B. Test results of the single SMA wire The output ability of the SMA-electric motor hybrid
actuator mainly lied on the character of SMA wires, especially the displacement output when heating or cooling with constant load. And this actuation capability of a single SMA wire was tested which results showed as figure 6. So the available load of this hybrid actuator could be below 250MPa.

Figure 4. The displacement output in a single-step simulation of the hybrid actuator. (Heating electric current I was set at 5A, and th=0.8s, td=0.2s)

C. Prototype experiment results
The displacement-time curves in a single-step movement and a multiple-steps movement were shown in figure 7. For the large diameter and the low electrical resistance of the SMA wires, a longer time was required for the reversible SMA phase transformation under room temperature by natural convection. Currently, a single cycle spent about 20 seconds and the frequency of the SMA hybrid linear actuator needed further improvement. The structure of the hybrid linear actuator also needs further optimization.

(c) 6.0A heating cycles iteration
Figure 8. Single-step repeatability of the hybrid linear actuator under different heating currents

The repeatability of the SMA-motor hybrid linear actuator tested under different heating currents 3.5A, 4.5A and 6.0A as figure 8 shown. Through the statistical analysis, the displacement of a single-step actuation was

Ls = 3.34 ± 0.02 mm

(20)

Thus, the displacement of multi-step actuation could be described as

L = n Ls

(21)

where -35 < n < 35. And n is the step movement number of this hybrid linear actuator, limited by the total length of the screw.

VI. CONCLUSION
A new type of hybrid linear actuator consisting of SMA wires and DC motors was designed in this paper. In many engineering fields, like aerospace and robotics, the hybrid linear actuators have several advantages, such as large output force, long stroke and accurate position control. But the prototype of this hybrid linear actuator was still simple and hulking. And the multi-steps operation frequency under ambient atmosphere was low limited by the cooling speed of SMA wires. In the future, we will do some other experiment to confirm its stability and advantage for increasing its actuation frequency.
