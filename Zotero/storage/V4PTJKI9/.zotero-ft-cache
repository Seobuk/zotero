Abstract—This paper proposes a novel artiﬁcial muscle, shape memory alloy (SMA) spring bundle actuator (SSBA), which can be applied to robotic arms while replacing the motor-gear mechanism. Artiﬁcial muscles applicable to robotic arms should have characteristics, such as high contraction strain comparable to that of skeletal muscles, high load capacity, fast actuation frequency, and force/position controllability. To improve the low efﬁciency and slow cooling of the Joule heating, which is widely used for SMA heating, the SMA spring bundle is heated and cooled using hot and cold water. A faucet-like valve was developed to control the temperature of water supplied to the SSBA, and the force generated by the SSBA with respect to the water temperature change was conﬁrmed to be very linear compared to that of the conventional SMA actuators. Owing to this linearity, the force control of the SSBA was easy by using a simple proportional-integral-derivative controller. A bundle weighing 12 g and consisting of 24 SMA springs was able to actuate with a contraction strain of more than 50% and actuating frequency of 1 Hz under a mass condition of 10 kg. Further, it could generate 130 N of force with respect to a temperature change from 28 °C to 82 °C. The ﬂexion–extension motion of an arm of 1-Hz actuating speed was possible by applying two SSBAs antagonistically to an arm of one degree-of-freedom. This proposed artiﬁcial muscle offers the possibility of lightweight and safe robotic arms.

I. INTRODUCTION
R ECENTLY, since human–robot collaboration (HRC) robots, which work in the same space as humans, are gaining increasing attention, studies are being actively conducted to ensure safety even in case of collision between robots and workers. Most HRC robots are made up of motor-gear mechanisms, and even a robotic arm with a payload of 5 kg is heavier than 20 kg. Unlike these robots, humans move with very

soft, light muscles. To develop a lightweight and safe robotic arm, the development of artiﬁcial muscles that can contract to the same level as the skeletal muscle and can generate a large force with a light weight should be promoted.
To utilize artiﬁcial muscles in robots, it is necessary to secure fast actuating frequency and controllability of force or position. If robots can be made lightweight by using these artiﬁcial muscles, which are as ﬂexible as skeletal muscles, have a large strain, and can generate larger power than skeletal muscles, intrinsic safety could be secured.
One of the most commonly used materials for artiﬁcial muscles are shape memory alloy (SMA) wires, which have the characteristic of recovering their original shape through the “shape memory effect” when heat is applied even if the shape is deformed. They are often used as linear actuators because they have beneﬁcial characteristics such as lightweightness, ﬂexibility, silent operation, and high power-to-weight ratios [1]. In addition, a large force can be achieved by bundling a large number of SMA wires [2]–[4]. Mosley et al. [2] presented a bundling set of 48 SMA wires that could apply a force large enough to lift up 45 kg [2]. However, SMA wires have a disadvantage in that the strain is very small (less than 5%), and therefore the length of the actuator must be long enough to produce the desired displacement. For example, an SMA wire of 1,000 mm is required to achieve a contraction of 50 mm with a 5% strain. To overcome the small strain of SMA wires, it is possible to amplify contracting displacement by using pulleys; however, the force exerted by SMA wires is reduced inversely and the structure becomes complicated [5], [6].
SMA springs, which are developed by annealing SMA wires by coiling on a rod, are capable of high contraction strain of several tens of percentages [7]–[10]. However, if the SMA springs are actuated through Joule heating and free-air convection cooling, the problems of low efﬁciency and slow response still remain. In case of using Joule heating, when the SMA wires or SMA springs come into contact with each other during operation, a spark is caused by a short circuit. Therefore, each element must be arranged with sufﬁcient space so that the volume of the bundle increases and the number of bundle elements is limited [2]–[4], [10].
The actuating frequency of SMA actuators mainly depends on the cooling time because heating time can be reduced by increasing the supplied power [11]. To improve the cooling speed, a heat sink [11], [12] is applied or forced-air convection cooling is conducted using a fan [13]–[16] or an air compressor [17], [18]; however, there is a limit to improve the cooling

speed. To further improve the actuating speed, Joule heating can be combined with oil cooling or water cooling [19]–[21]. However, in this case, heat loss due to the cooling ﬂuid increases power consumption and slows the heating rate. As a result, this method also has a limit to improve the overall actuating speed.
Some studies have used water in both heating and cooling processes to improve the low efﬁciency and slow cooling speed of Joule heating [22]–[27]. The dynamics of a wet SMA actuator in a compliant tube is modeled to understand how the actuator responds to a thermoﬂuidic input that propagates from one end of the actuator to the other [23]–[25]. Rediniotis et al. [27] showed 3% strain at 0.5 Hz actuating frequency by alternately supplying hot and cold water to the SMA strip with a length of 254 mm in the tube by using a solenoid valve. The actuating frequency was improved; however, the contraction strain and load capacity were small, and force or position control was impossible as the supply of hot and cold water was switched only through the valve. Park and Son [29] presented an artiﬁcial muscle consisting of a bundle of ﬁve SMA springs and a stretchable tube to overcome the disadvantages of SMA wires and the aforementioned SMA springs. They demonstrated that a faucet-like valve can smoothly change the temperature of the water ﬂowing around the SMA springs.
In this paper, we propose an SMA spring bundle actuator (SSBA) that can generate a larger force by bundling 24 SMA springs. The SSBA consists of an SMA spring bundle enclosed in a stretchable silicone tube that provides a path for water to ﬂow inside. The SSBA uses water to heat and cool the SMA spring bundles to improve the actuating frequency. We statistically quantiﬁed how the force output of the SSBA and the single spring varied, and presented how linear they were. In addition, the force and position of the SSBA are controlled by adjusting the temperature of water supplied to the inside. To this end, a temperature control valve is placed at the entrance of the SSBA which mixes hot and cold water in appropriate proportions to provide the required water temperature. By controlling the water temperature, the temperature of the SMA spring bundle and the force and displacement of the SSBA can be controlled. This paper presents an SSBA that can contract and relax with an actuating frequency of 1 Hz and a contraction strain of more than 50% under a 10-kg load condition. We also show that the proposed artiﬁcial muscle can be applied to a lightweight and safe robot arm by demonstrating a ﬂexion–extension motion of 1-Hz actuation speed after applying two SSBAs antagonistically to an arm of one degree-of-freedom.

The force–displacement relationship in an SMA spring (Fig. 2) is given by (1) under the assumption that the spring deformation is small [7].

generated by the SMA spring, and G is the shear modulus [10]. The spring index C is deﬁned as the ratio of the spring diameter to the wire diameter (C = D/d). The procedure to fabricate SMA springs is as follows. The SMA wire is wound around a steel rod with a diameter selected for the designed spring index. The winding can be performed manually or automatically by using a winding jig, and both ends of the wire are ﬁxed to the steel rod by bolts [28]. The wound wire on the steel rod is then annealed at 350 °C for 30 min in an electric furnace for memorization of the spring shape.
Table I describes the speciﬁcation of SMA spring fabricated in this study. B. SMA Spring Bundle
Skeletal muscles are bundles of muscle ﬁbers. As the number of muscle ﬁbers and muscle cross-sectional area increase, the load capacity of the muscle increases. The SMA spring bundle was developed by mimicking the skeletal muscle by collecting the wires at the both ends of the SMA springs and ﬁxing them by using ring connectors, as shown in Fig. 1. An SMA spring bundle increases the force in proportion to the number of SMA springs. As the SMA spring bundle is made of ﬂexible springs, it is a soft actuator that can be ﬂexibly bent and smoothly deformed even when using a small force, as shown in Fig. 3. C. Consideration of Heating and Cooling Method
For fast heating and cooling of the SMA springs, Joule heating and forced-air convection, respectively, are commonly used. If

the voltage or current is high enough to rapidly increase the temperature of the SMA spring, the contraction speed of the SMA springs can be increased. However, forced-air convection is limited in improving the actuating frequency of the SMA spring because the cooling speed of an SMA spring is still slow. To improve the cooling speed, it is possible to apply electric current while immersing the SMA spring in water. However, in this method, as the heat is considerably dissipated in water, the heating performance is remarkably degraded, thus decreasing the efﬁciency and contraction speed. In this study, the heating/cooling method using hot/cold water was used to improve the actuating speed of the SMA spring bundle.
D. Fabrication of SSBA
To use the water to heat and cool the SMA spring bundle, a tube should be used as a channel for the water to ﬂow around the SMA spring bundle. This tube should be able to be stretched and contracted along with the length of the SMA spring. For this purpose, tubes were fabricated using highly stretchable silicone (Ecoﬂex 00-30, Smooth-On, Inc., USA). The SSBA comprises an SMA spring bundle, a stretchable silicone tube, and connectors for the water inlet and outlet. A ﬂexible, well-stretchable silicone tube stretches and contracts according to the displacement of the SMA spring bundle and behaves as a channel for hot and cold water.
An aluminum mold is prepared for molding the silicone into the designed tube’s diameter and length. Liquid silicone is injected into the mold and cured in a vacuum chamber for 3 h. The mold is disassembled to complete a stretchable silicone tube, which has an inner diameter of 17.5 mm, thickness of 1 mm, and length of 65 mm. Fig. 5 shows the fabrication process

of the SSBA. First, 24ea SMA springs were prepared. The total mass of 24ea SMA springs is 12 g. The SMA spring bundle was assembled by clipping the end-wires of the SMA spring, and it was placed into the stretchable silicone tube. At both the ends of the SSAB, connectors were assembled for water inlet and outlet.
III. WATER TEMPERATURE CONTROL BY USING FAUCET-LIKE VALVE
If SSBA is simply used as a contracting and relaxing actuator, a three-way solenoid valve can be used to switch hot and cold water. However, if SSBA is used for applications requiring force or position control, such as a robotic arm or a linear stage, the force and position of the SSBA must be controlled. For this purpose, the temperature of the SMA spring bundle should be controlled by adjusting the temperature of the water supplied to the SSBA. In addition, another method is required to replace the solenoid valve, which can only switch between hot and cold water.
Household faucets have excellent manual mechanism to control the temperature of the water exiting the outlet [29]. By adjusting the angle of the inner disk with the handle of the faucet, the temperature of the water exiting the outlet is controlled by adjusting the mixing ratio of the hot and cold water supplied through two inlets (Fig. 6(a)). Similar to these faucets, an automatic faucet-like valve was fabricated in this study comprising a DC motor instead of a faucet handle. The diameter, length, and weight of the DC motor (2619S012SR, Faulhaber, Germany) are 26, 21, and 30 g, respectively. By controlling the angle of the disk installed inside the valve by using this DC motor, the temperature of the water discharged to the outlet can be controlled (Fig. 6(b) and (c)). The angular range in which the DC motor moves the disk inside the valve

is 0◦–65◦. At the 0◦–10◦ positions, the incoming cold water is discharged as is, and at the 60◦–65◦ positions, the incoming hot water is discharged as is. At a position between 10° and 60°, water is discharged at a temperature where hot and cold water are mixed. The outlet of the faucet-like valve is connected to the inlet of the SSBA, and the mixed water supplied through it changes the temperature of the SMA spring bundle. A thermocouple was installed at the outlet of the faucet-like valve and the temperature of the water entering the SSBA was measured. The water was supplied to the hot and cold water inlets through pumps at a maximum ﬂow rate of 2 L/min, while maintaining the water temperature of the external hot water tank and the cold water tank at 100 °C and 28 °C, respectively. Then, the temperature of the mixed water was measured while increasing and decreasing the valve disk angle in 4◦ intervals from 0◦ to 64◦. It takes ∼0.07 s for the valve to rotate by 4°. The temperature of the mixed water was determined to linearly increase and decrease from 28 °C to 98 °C at positions between 10◦ and 60◦ (Fig. 7).
Fig. 8 shows a simple experimental setup to measure the actuation performance of the SSBA. One each of hot- and coldwater tanks were installed outside, as shown in Fig. 8, and water was supplied through pumps to inlets of faucet-like valves. Hot

and cold water were mixed in a faucet-like valve, and then delivered to the outlet of the valve. The mixed water enters the inlet of SSBA immediately, it changes the temperature of the SMA spring bundle, and is discharged. To measure the force generated by the SSBA, the load cell was attached to the upper end of the SSBA and ﬁxed to the frame. At the lower end of the SSBA, a mass was attached to allow the SSBA to relax and stretch because of the weight of the mass when cold water was supplied. Below the mass, a laser displacement sensor was installed to measure the contraction–relaxation displacement of the SSBA.
The initial length of the SSBA was measured under the condition that the mass was suspended at the end of the SSBA and the water was supplied to the SSBA at the low-temperature condition of 28 °C. Then, the contraction length of the SSBA was measured while water was supplied to the SSBA at a high temperature in an increasing range from 40 °C to 93 °C. The contraction displacement (dl) of the SSBA is measured as the difference between the initial length (l0) and contracted length (l1), and the contraction strain of the SSBA is expressed as follows:

Contraction strain(%) = dl × 100.

The active coil length of the fabricated SMA spring bundle is 26 mm. The coil of the SSBA was stretched to the length of 75 mm when 7 kg of mass was suspended at the lower end of the SSBA while supplying water at 28 °C. At this time, when water was supplied at 93 °C, the coil contracted to a length of approximately 43.3 mm while generating a contraction displacement of 30.7 mm. The contraction strain in this case is approximately 41% according to Eq. (2). The active coil

Contraction displacement is the difference in the SSBA length under low- and high-temperature conditions. The contraction displacements for a light mass dcl and a heavy mass dch are dll − dhl anddlh − dhh , respectively, where dll and dhl are the stretched length of SSBA for a light mass under low- and high-temperature conditions, respectively, and dlh and dhh are the stretched lengths of SSBA for a heavy mass under low- and high-temperature conditions, respectively. Because the spring constant of SSBA is lower under low-temperature condition than under high-temperature condition, the difference in stretched length with a light mass and a heavy mass is larger at low temperature than at high temperature, as expressed by (3). Here, (3) can be rearranged as (4) or (5). As a result, the contraction displacement increases with mass.

of the SSBA was stretched to the length of 133 mm when 10 kg of mass was suspended at its lower end, while supplying water at 28 °C. At this time, when the water was supplied at 93 °C, the coil contracted to a length of approximately 58.2 mm while generating a contraction displacement of 74.8 mm. The contraction strain in this case is approximately 58%. Fig. 9 shows the change in SSBA length when SSBA is supplied with 28 °C and 93 °C water, respectively, under the mass condition of 10 kg.
By using the same method described earlier, lengths and contraction strains of the SSBA were measured for the cases in which masses in the range of 7–10 kg were suspended at the lower end of the SSBA, which is supplied with water at low and high temperatures of 28 °C and 93 °C (Fig. 10).

Fig. 11 shows the contraction displacements of the SSBA for different masses based on the initial length of the SSBA at the low-temperature condition of 28 °C when water at a high temperature range of 40 °C–93 °C is supplied. The contraction displacements tended to increase continuously to 93 °C under all the mass conditions. However, when the temperature increased from 83 °C to 93 °C, the displacement did not increase significantly. Next, while increasing the actuating frequency for the SSBA from 0.1 to 1.67 Hz, the contraction displacements and strains with respect to the actuating frequency of the SSBA were measured.
In this experiment, the disk of the faucet-like valve could control the water temperature supplied to the SSBA from 28 °C to 93 °C by rotating from 0° to 60° full stroke. It took 0.26 s to rotate the disk of the valve to the full stroke range, and the actuating frequency was changed by adjusting the stop duration after full stroke rotation. For example, one cycle of disk rotation consisted of the following four steps to generate an actuating frequency of 1 Hz: (1) rotation from 0° to 60° (0.26 s), (2)

stop (0.24 s), (3) rotation from 0° to 60° (0.26 s), and (4) stop (0.24 s). A 10-kg mass was suspended at the lower end of the SSBA during this experiment (Fig. 12). At actuating frequencies of 0.17 and 0.5 Hz, the contraction displacements were 70.8 and 69.9 mm and contraction strains were 56% and 53.2%, respectively. Even at actuating frequency of 1 Hz, the contraction displacement was 67.5 mm and contraction strain was 50.7% (Fig. 13). Considering the 10-kg-mass condition, these are relatively high contraction strains when compared with that of skeletal muscle with 40% strain [30]. At actuating frequency of 1.67 Hz, the contraction displacement and strain decreased to 38 mm and 28.7%, respectively. It seems that because there is insufﬁcient heat transfer time from the water to the SMA springs, the contraction displacement decreases as the actuating frequency increases.
IV. FORCE CONTROL OF SSBA
This section discusses the feasibility of the force control of the SSBA. The isometric test setup was constructed, as shown

in Fig. 14, and the relationship between the water temperature supplied to the SSBA and the force generated by the SSBA was measured. The SSBA was pulled such that an initial tensile force of 10 N was applied to the load cell, and then it was ﬁxed to the frame while water was supplied at a low temperature of 28 °C. Then, if the temperature of the water supplied to the SSBA was increased, the SSBA contracted, and the contraction force of the SSBA was transferred to the load cell. The contraction force was measured after waiting for 3 s at a certain water temperature so that the temperature of SSBA and water became uniform. This experiment was conducted by increasing the water temperature from 28 °C to 82 °C and then reducing it again. We repeated this experiment 12 times and plotted the average force versus temperature with error bars to represent the standard deviations, as shown in Fig. 15(a). When the temperature was increased from 28 °C to 82 °C, the force applied to the load cell was 140 N, and the SSBA generated an additional contraction force of 130 N compared to that in the 28 °C condition. Based on the results of this experiment, if the SSBA needs to generate less than 80 N contraction force, it is enough to supply the SSBA with water in the temperature range of 28 °C to 60 °C. Considering the range of contraction force that the SSBA needs to generate and the available temperature range of hot and cold water, it is possible to select the appropriate temperature range to supply to the SSBA. A typical SMA shows large hysteresis and nonlinearity in the temperature–force relationship; however, SSBA did not show such characteristics in this experiment but showed better linearity and smaller hysteresis. The slopes of the linear ﬁttings of red and blue lines in Fig. 15(a) are 2.58 and 2.62, respectively, and their R2 values are 0.994 and 0.982, respectively.
The same experiments were performed for a single SMA spring to see whether the single SMA spring has a linear response like SSBA. The results are shown in Fig. 15(b). The

Fig. 15. Measured forces versus water temperature supplied to (a) the SSBA and (b) the single spring while temperature is increased (red line) and decreased (blue line).
slopes of the linear ﬁttings of red and blue lines in Fig. 15(b) are 0.116 and 0.118, respectively and their R2 values are 0.993 and 0.992, respectively. Based on this, it can be considered that the linearity of the SSBA is a result of the linearity of a single SMA spring, and the SSBA is expected to operate in a manner similar to a linear system rather than a nonlinear system.
The SMA spring showed a linear force vs. temperature relationship that is contrary to the nonlinearity of the SMA wire. One of the hypotheses for the linearity of the SMA spring can be set as follows.
The higher the prestress in the SMA wire, the higher is the transition temperature (Ttr ) of the SMA wire [31]. When an isometric test is performed on the SMA wire, the prestress is uniformly distributed on the cross section of the wire, so that Ttr for the applied stress is uniformly determined throughout the wire. Therefore, a sudden increase in force at this predetermined Ttr is observed. Unlike the SMA wire, the axial force acting on the spring acts as a torsional moment on the cross section of the SMA spring, and the shear stress increases as the radius goes from the center of the cross section to the outer diameter

[7], [9]. When the isometric test is performed on the SMA spring, the initial shear stress, τ0(r), along the cross-sectional radius of the SMA spring is distributed by the initial axial force acting on the SMA spring. For simplicity, it is assumed that the shear stress is linearly distributed along the radius, as shown in Fig. 16(a), and the initial transition temperature Ttr0(r) along the radius is determined by τ0(r), as shown in Fig. 16(b). When the temperature of the SMA spring increases, the transformation from martensite to austenite starts from the center (r = 0) of the cross section where the transition temperature is the lowest. Consequently, the axial force acting on the spring increases and the shear stress on the cross section of the spring increases to τnew (r), as shown in Fig. 16(c). If the inner part of the spring section (0 ≤ r ≤ r1) is transformed into austenite, the transition temperature of the outer cross-sectional area (r1 < r ≤ R) that still remains in martensite increases to the new transition temperature, Ttr new (r), by the increased shear stress, as shown in Fig. 16(d). This process repeats as the temperature increases, and the transition temperature of the outermost part of the cross section continues to increase due to the increased shear stress until the entire outermost section transforms to austenite. For this reason, in the SMA spring under the isometric test condition, the transition temperature is a function of the cross-sectional radius and temperature. Therefore, the contraction force of the SMA spring gradually increases or decreases and results in the linearity of the force vs. temperature relationship because the transformation occurs locally in the cross-sectional radius of the SMA spring. To prove this hypothesis, further study including thermo-mechanical modeling and experiments on the SMA spring are needed.
Next, to evaluate the force control feasibility of the SSBA, a force control loop was constructed using the experimental setup in Fig. 14 and the experiment was performed. The error

between the result of the feedback of the force measured by the load cell and the reference force was input to a proportionalintegral-derivative (PID) controller of a simple structure. The PID controller outputs a command to change the angle of the DC motor of the faucet-like valve so that the appropriate temperature water, which is produced by mixing hot and cold water, passes through the SSBA. Here, the PID gains were determined through repeated trial and error. The force control performance was evaluated using step reference forces that increase and decrease by 10 N while maintaining for 10 s to verify that SSBA can generate force according to the given reference force. This experimental result is shown in Fig. 17. As the reference force (green line) changes, the temperature of the water supplied (red line) also changes. As the temperature rises to 60 °C, an additional 80 N force is generated. In the force range of 60–100 N, the measured force (blue line) showed a good step response performance that follows the reference force even when using a simple PID controller. If intelligent control algorithms, such as neural network, can be applied in the future, it would be possible to improve the force control performance in the whole range. Position control is also possible with the addition of a position control loop outside the force control loop.
V. ACTUATING TEST IN ANTAGONISTIC STRUCTURE
This section shows whether the ﬂexion–extension motion, such as that of skeletal muscles, can be achieved by the SSBA by arranging it in an antagonistic structure. In the experimental setup shown in Fig. 18, the upper arm, forearm, and hand were made using a 3D printer, and their weights were 124, 86, and 177 g, respectively. Two SSBAs with the same speciﬁcations were placed antagonistically on the biceps (SSBA1) and the triceps (SSBA2) of an arm skeleton of one degree-of-freedom, and the motion range of the elbow joint by SSBAs was measured. SSBA1 and SSBA2 are respectively equipped with faucet-like valves to control the temperature of water independently. A magnetic encoder was placed on the elbow joint to measure the angle between the upper and lower arms. The angle between

the extension line of the upper and lower arms was deﬁned as elbow angle α. The temperature of the water discharged from the faucet-like valve was increased from 28 °C to 93 °C over a period of 0.5 s, and then maintained at the high temperature for 0.5 s. Next, the water temperature was decreased from 93 °C to 28 °C over a period of 0.5 s, and then maintained at the low temperature for 0.5 s. The changes in the elbow angles were measured while repeating this process [Fig. 19(a)]. The elbow repeated ﬂexion and extension motions regularly while performing the motion range of 62.5◦ between 53◦ and 115.5◦. The maximum motion range of the elbow can be considered to be 62.5◦ as there is no change in the angle of water when the temperature is maintained at a low or high temperature. This is much less than the motion range of 140◦ from 5◦ to 145◦ of the elbow of a normal person [32]. Despite the contraction strain of the SSBA being higher than that of the skeletal muscle,

its smaller motion range when it is applied to the ﬂexion and extension of the arm could be because SSBAs are fabricated shorter than the average length of human biceps and triceps. The motion range could be increased if the SSBAs were made of a length similar to that of the human-arm muscles and the position at which the SSBAs were connected to the links was optimized. Here, the force measured by the load cells at the maximum ﬂexion position when actuating at 0.5 Hz was 130 N and 80 N for SSBA1 and SSBA2, respectively. Because the distance between the rotational center of the forearm and the point where the SSBAs act on the forearm is 34 mm, the torque generated by the SSBAs is 1,700 N·mm. Based on the experimental results, the SSBA was conﬁrmed to actuate the links by arranging antagonistically on the same principle of the skeletal muscle. Fig. 19(b) shows the changes in the elbow angle measured while increasing the temperature of the water discharged from the faucet-like valve from 28 °C to 93 °C over a period of 0.5 s and immediately decreasing from 93 °C to 28 °C over a period of 0.5 s. Here, the elbow repeated the ﬂexion and extension motions while producing an angular difference of 54.5◦ between 58.5◦ and 113◦. As the SMA spring bundles in the SSBAs did not have enough time to be heated and cooled, the motion range was smaller than that produced in the previous experimental results (Fig. 19(a)); however, the ﬂexion–extension motions were possible at a speed of 1 Hz.
VI. CONCLUSION
We proposed an SSBA that can contract and relax with the changing water temperature by using a faucet-like valve and presented its performance evaluation results. A bundle of 12-g mass consisting of 24 SMA springs was able to actuate with a contraction strain of more than 50% and actuating frequency of 1 Hz under a mass condition of 10 kg. In addition, the bundle could generate 130 N of force based on the temperature change from 28 °C to 82 °C, and force control was possible by adjusting the water temperature. In addition, we showed the possibility of applying SSBAs to robotic arms by conﬁrming the ﬂexion and extension motions by using an antagonistic structure ﬁxed to the arm with one degree-of-freedom. To improve the heating/cooling speed of the SSBA to increase the actuating speed, the SMA spring may be fabricated using an SMA wire of a smaller diameter than the 0.5-mm-diameter SMA wire used in this study. The force generated by the SSBA is adjustable according to the number of SMA springs used in the bundle.
For the SSBA actuated by water temperature, a water circulation system that supplies heating and cooling water is very important. Further research is needed on water circulation systems that can improve the overall heat cycle efﬁciency while considering both the water heating/cooling and the energy required to actuate the SSBA. We will also focus on reducing the size and complexity of water circulation system.
In this study, SSBAs were applied to the ﬂexion and extension of the lower arm; however, we will develop SSBAs of different sizes and apply them to supination and pronation motions in the future. Furthermore, if the SSBAs can be applied to the shoulder movement including the arm, it will be possible to

develop lightweight robotic arms capable of working similar to human arms.
